roughly speaking, what does this mean, specifically?  i ask because i totally understand your concern on:

> i am having a hard time justifying the cost of going to Harvard University

otherwise, some quick notes:

> i'm also trying to understand how much support Harvard University students get in terms of securing jobs/internships and how Harvard University cs degrees are seen in the tech industry compared to a berkeley eecs degree.

you will have zero issues here.  more opportunity for highly selective finance/hedge fund jobs (hft etc.), if you care about that, otherwise will look pretty similar (obviously easier to go hunting to join a small bay startup if you are in the bay...but the advent of zoom/pandemic is of course warping that, anyway).

> research opportunities

nominally easier at h, simply due to student body size, but if this is truly important to you, i'd focus more on what the faculty are working on--if it is something you're excited about, you can make research happen at both places.  (might be a little less hand-holding in this regard at cal, but gumption gets you most places in life, anyway.)  

e.g., if research opportunities at bleeding edge of deep learning are your focus, cal is likely the better choice (unless there is a particular prof at h that excites, e.g.).

> class size/dynamic

this is really the biggest one.  cal and Harvard University vastly different environments, in terms of student body, expectations (of students and by students), etc.  i'm probably not going to immediately add much that is unique, here--what are you looking for?  

overall, big picture, without knowing you any beyond your note:

* you're right to flag cost.

* cs degree from cal will get you anywhere you want to go in the job market.

* if you're focused on research, that is going to further narrow any relative holistic advantage Harvard University might have (b/c cal is super strong).

hat tip to h if you're excited to go to school with what is probably the most ambitious student body out there (maybe a tie w/ Stanford University , although the laid-back cali attitude will dampen some of the external manifestations).

it really depends on what you are interested in, but i found Harvard University's approach to cs to be a lot more theory-based than i would like compared to Carnegie Mellon University or Massachusetts Institute of Technology. that's not to say that the department is not a strong department, its just that there needs to be more time for the department to mature and move away from its applied math roots. conversely, the few ""hands-on"" courses that are there seem to have way too much busywork and end up just being a ton of implementation work. i found the machine learning course (cs 181) to be straight-up awful but from what i understand there has been some faculty changes since when i briefly took it and dropped the course before the add/drop period.

i would mirror what others have said in this thread and i would strongly avoid cs50. it was what turned me off to cs and if it wasn't for a particularly amazing cs faculty member who took me under his wing and mentored me, i would have not ever considered cs. cs50 caters to its own brand not to those who are genuinely interested in computer science. you would never see anything like that course in any ""real"" cs department. it creates a false sense of ""cs is fun"", which seriously rubs me the wrong way.",Comment,Neutral

Harvard University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard University/comments/89vx6d/Harvard University_cs_question/,"current Harvard University seas. was debating b/w Stanford University  and Harvard University.

Harvard University seas is fine. it's not great, it's certainly not terrible, it's just fine. education-wise, it's definitely not as comprehensive or applied as Stanford University , cal, or Massachusetts Institute of Technology but it's fine. recruiting-wise is also fine: career fairs have the typical google/facebook/salesforce/airbnb gamut of companies. don't worry about which jobs you can get and which college you can get them from. i have Harvard University friends who came in with 0 cs experience and who ended up doing stuff at google, microsoft, facebook, startups, whatever. that's less dependent on your degree (since you're already considering cal and ga tech) and more on which projects you've worked on and how well you do in the interview. you'll be fine.

a good (or bad?) part of Harvard University seas is that it's pretty closed without being insular. seas isn't as popular at Harvard University as it is for other tech-oriented schools, which makes for a pretty intimate learning experience (relatively easy to get access to professors (variable, of course) and the classes don't run huge except for cs50). you get a lot more attention than at some other places. there's also less of a stereotype surrounding cs and seas, which means that you make friends outside of just your department and people don't actually care what you're majoring in since everyone's so interdisciplinary here. Harvard University's cs is also more theoretical than some other places, meaning you'll have experience doing fancy-ass algorithms and build operating systems. if that's your thing, Harvard University does a great job of it. Harvard University's seas is much smaller than cal eecs and you'll have access to Massachusetts Institute of Technology courses as well if you choose to go that route. switching concentrations is also easier than at cal and other direct adMassachusetts Institute of Technology programs, so if you have a coming-to-ec moment you don't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops.

from a personal experience, i'm pretty happy here. i can take whatever classes i want and know i'm almost guaranteed to graduate on time and the professors are chill enough to help out whenever i'm stressed. i can also walk into office hours and have face-to-face time with every professor rather than having to reserve an appointment five weeks ahead. my gpa is also not in the tank (two friends at cal: 2.7 and 2.5 respectively). i didn't come in necessarily wanting to do a whole lot of engineering but that's fine because i wasn't a direct adMassachusetts Institute of Technology and i'm still able to switch to anything else if i wanted to. choice is entirely up to you. like i mentioned, there's a lot of interesting stuff at Harvard University and you'll be able to pivot easily.",Comment,Neutral

2.) go after unofficial summer positions and less prestigious locations/organizations. even with the Harvard University name, it s really really difficult to get internships when you have to apply as a freshman. chances are, if it s a company/organization you ve heard of and has an online application, they re getting 100+ applications mostly from uperclassmen. either find organizations/startups that most people haven t heard of, or find internships that don t have applications by emailing people at organizations you like that don t have postings and asking to intern with them. that way you won t be competing against 100 seniors. 

3.) join campus clubs that have multiple years of students. first year programs and friend groups are great and all, but all-frosh friend groups are fragile af and they won t be able to help you with academic advice or navigating Harvard University systems. having even a few uperclassmen friends will replace what those advisors are supposedly for and will lend some stability to your social circles.

academics-wise, i definitely second the advice to take easier classes - it s not high school anymore, there are no rewards for pushing yourself too hard.  also make sure you re taking classes that interest you and that you want to put in the work for.  when i came back for sophomore year, i switched from taking classes in the concentration i thought i  should  do to classes that i actually was excited about, and holy crap it made so much difference in my willingness to work and therefore my grades.  and take advantage of office hours, with tas as well as profs - it s what they re there for and it super helps!! - and look to form study groups if your entryway-mates or other people you know are in the same class. 

mental health wise - if uhs isn t helping, what about exploring some of the peer counseling options on campus?  i would also talk to your ra (or whatever they call the person who lives in your entryway, it s been 10 yrs and i ve forgotten) and your academic advisor - they could be good sources of help.  agree that pafs probably aren t a great resource for this.  and just remember - loads of other people are in / have been in the same boat as you.  the social experience freshman year is hard!

Stanford University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stanford University /comments/twasaz/Stanford University _vs_Harvard University_for_cs/,"i'm an incoming mscs student at Stanford University , so while i haven't started the program yet, i can talk about some of the reasons i chose Stanford University  over the gt phd program with a fellowship.

generally, Stanford University  is considered a clear tier 1 cs school (along with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, and uc berkeley), while Harvard University's reputation for cs is less well-defined (i would say it's more of a top 20 program). however, rankings of course are not everything, so i'll list a few pros/cons based on the potential career paths you may choose.

research

this means that you will want to get an advanced degree, and most likely a phd. currently, the field is hypercompetitive (especially in ml), and i feel like the advantage of coming from Stanford University  would make a massive difference. many of the Stanford University  faculty are extremely well known, so doing undergraduate research with them would be a great help to your application. the faculty also have many industry connections due to proxiMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy to big-tech companies and might even be able to secure you an internship.

of course, you will still need to do excellent research at either school to have a shot at a phd program. however, i know that even the best students at non tier 1 universities (such as gt) cannot get adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted to competitive phd programs. i myself got rejected to 6/7 (more details are under my profile), getting only into my undergrad university's program.

industry

to be honest, if your goal is to just become an swe at a tech company, i don't think the choice matters. it's pretty common to be able to find fb/google/microsoft/unicorn/etc. internships and full-time roles at gt, so i'm sure that both Harvard University and Stanford University  would have you covered on this front.

if you want to become an swe/quant at a hedgefund/prop firm, this may be different. i know that many of these companies do care about university a lot (i think five rings only recruits from Harvard University and Princeton University  or something along those lines). from personal experience, i know the famous firms have an internal ranking of schools. for instance, jane street only started recruiting from gt very recently. i can see Harvard University having a slight advantage here, but i don't think it would be significant at all given Stanford University 's overall reputation.",Comment,Positive

the cs department is pretty small, as other people have said, which means that there aren't as many research areas as at a bigger school. for example, my interest is in formal verification and programming language theory, which doesn't have a research presence on campus. so, my undergraduate research journey has been a lot more *ad hoc* than it might have been at say, University of Pennsylvania or Carnegie Mellon University.

even though it's very academically difficult, i'm really glad i ended up at California Institute of Technology.",Comment,Neutral
Stanford University,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/u3p7qm/California Institute of Technology_vs_Stanford University _cs_physics/,"it's been a few years since i was at California Institute of Technology, so i may not be up-to-date with the major requirements, but when i was there i didn't know anyone who double-majored in cs and physics. cs and math, yes, but not cs and physics. i'm not saying that it can't be done or that nobody did it, but it may be a particularly difficult endeavor. (this may have more to do with scheduling than with academic difficulty.)

other considerations:

**academic stress**

i don't know much about Stanford University 's cs curriculum, but professors and students who have been to both schools have said that Stanford University 's undergraduate curriculum is significantly easier and more relaxed than California Institute of Technology's. (professor lewis taught chem. 1a in a year at Stanford University  but in 10 weeks at California Institute of Technology, professor rangel had to increase the difficulty of ec. 11 when he moved to California Institute of Technology from Stanford University  because California Institute of Technology students were scoring 20% higher on the exams, etc.) one approach isn't necessarily better than the other. for example, learning a lot is cool, but spending 50+ hours/week on schoolwork and feeling like you don't understand what's going on in your classes is not very fun. and you don't always learn more by *trying* to learn more - to use a poor analogy, drinking from a fire hose can result in swallowing less water than drinking from a water fountain.

one of my California Institute of Technology friends visited some of his friends at Stanford University  and, upon returning, reported to us that they laughed about how easy it was to get a's and spent a lot of their time playing frisbee. is that not preferable to staying up late writing proofs about matroids and flow networks? student's choice, i guess.

**jobs**

i'm somewhat skeptical of the argument that Stanford University  is noticeably better for cs jobs. pretty much everyone i knew at California Institute of Technology who wanted a high-paying job got one, including non-cs majors. in fact, my adviser informed me that 99% of all California Institute of Technology students who applied to google were accepted, and corrected me when i thought he was speaking rhetorically instead of citing a real statistic. recruiters from ""top-tier"" cs and finance companies visited campus multiple times a year and made it incredibly easy to apply. i'm sure the same thing happens at Stanford University , and i could see Stanford University  having a better atmosphere for entrepreneurs, but if your goal is to get a faang-type job then i wouldn't worry about having attended one school over the other.

**school atmosphere**

Stanford University  is a big school on a big campus full of many different kinds of people, while California Institute of Technology is a small school on a small campus populated almost exclusively by stem nerds. this can be a huuuge factor in determining what your social life will be like in college. to be honest, i would see this as the biggest consideration when deciding which school to attend, because you'll receive a first-class education at either school. but at California Institute of Technology, you're going to be around the same small group of people for four years, and they're all going to be studying science or engineering. sports and other non-stem extracurriculars exist, but on a much smaller scale than they do at Stanford University . for students who decide they no longer want to study stem, there aren't nearly as many escape routes as there are at Stanford University .

do those sound like potential issues to you? if so, i would say ""go to Stanford University ."" it's much more flexible and forgiving, and you'll have many more options for non-academic activities. California Institute of Technology is more hardcore and monastic, and being so comes with upsides and downsides. you want to really know what you'd be getting into before choosing to go there.",Comment,Neutral

Stanford University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stanford University /comments/zklcmw/i_hate_Stanford University _with_a_passion/,"hey buddy! i was in a similar position to you a couple years ago (graduated this june). a few thoughts:

1) Stanford University  has gotten far worse about hypercompetitiveness in recent years. it's orders of magnitude less fun than when i started in 2017 and even then, it was a dour place compared to how it was in the 2000s, 90s, and earlier. i made quite a few friends for life there and had a lot of fun, to be fair, but on the whole it's one of the most toxic places i've ever known. simply put, it functions like a world class business in the education sector instead of a good school. this does prepare you extremely well for a career, however, and you'll notice that life gets much easier after Stanford University  because of how much the pressure cooker enhances your performance, if that's any consolation.

2) it sounds like you have pretty serious depression in and of itself. there are few ways to make it improve long term beyond finding a great psychotherapist and experimenting with medicines as needed. having said that, even my most stable friends profoundly struggled with the extreme grind and isolation of Stanford University . as pessimistic as this may sound, i do believe you're truly stuck on this front. my heart goes out to you.

3) linkedin is a shit way of making connections. alumni meetups are much better, as is Stanford University  alumni mentoring. got my first internship thru there. go to a couple alumni meetups, particularly with the peninsula alumni club. kuldip, their president, is extremely kind and loves helping out current students. you'll find some folks who have interesting careers and would be happy to take you out to dinner to discuss their work and path, and once they get an idea of your interests they'll connect you to some other alumni who will do the same. they'll almost always pay for your meal, so incentivize yourself with a free fancy dinner to overcome the awkwardness, and repeat a dozen times until you're sorted. furthermore, if you have mental health issues and don't enjoy a hyper-competitive grind culture, you will loathe finance even more than Stanford University .

4) there's a serious discrepancy in short-term outcomes between students from wealthy & ultra wealthy backgrounds and everyone else (even 7 figure families). it's appalling and worsens the pressure cooker tremendously, because many Stanford University  students have infinite resources to fall back on and have been trained on how to perform well in this kind of environment and find great internships and jobs their entire lives. you're only starting to piece this together now, i'd wager, by getting an inkling of how the super successful kids function and trying to iMassachusetts Institute of Technologyate them to the best of your ability. do try to make friends with a lot of the super successful kids -- most folks at Stanford University  are nice and i'm sure you can find a couple who you can meaningfully bond with -- and over the years (including post grad) you'll learn how to operate like they do.

5) the best part about Stanford University , at least for me, was access to the bay area and california. people in the jungles of thailand have heard of san francisco. berkeley is famous across the usa. folks have their honeymoons out here because of how incredible this place is. find time, however and wherever you can, to get off campus. i usually went to sf a couple times a week and did at least a couple of ca roadtrips per quarter, despite my lack of an automobile and parental support. palo alto and the surrounding area are no good: too wealthy and boring to attract people who aren't corporate drones. in short, build a life outside of Stanford University . in the adult world, folks who live and breathe their work are considered nuts, and i wish this was more of the case on the farm.",Comment,Positive

take it from an old person 99% of the things we worry about never happen, put your mental health before anything else there's always time for school, and understand that there are many people feeling the same way you do even though you don't realize it. things will get better i promise you!

the thing that saved me was getting the fuck out of Stanford University  for a while (abuse Stanford University  s resources for this). study abroad & global studies summer were perspective shifting experiences and i felt like i interacted with the real versions of people (cause wow, finally not in the toxic Stanford University  bubble and in the real world). it was refreshing to also see how other people in the world approached life/careers and how crazy some Stanford University  kids are. allowed me to explore different classes and realize i hated my major (i switched my major junior win and still made it out).

highly recommend.

therapy also helped for me, but only once i consistently went. my brain tried all the time to convince me otherwise, helped to just not ponder and go.

Stanford University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stanford University /comments/zklcmw/i_hate_Stanford University _with_a_passion/,"i once suffered from depression when i felt stuck/didn't know what to do. and i do mean deep states of depression, practically at psychosis/the world turned yellow, there would never be joy and yeah, thoughts of ending it. i started reading albert ellis ""a guide to rational living"" (he was a founder of cognitive therapy, but he called it cognitive behavioral therapy), but you could call it rational stoicism. it took me a couple years, but i just fell into things i liked, but ellis stuff really helped settle me out ... and years later it helped me start a business and deal with some extremely stressful situations. that's my first suggestion, for me it just became a kind of ""brain, the user's manual"".

second, i'm now in my 60s. i could have retired maybe 2 decades ago, but i still don't really know what i want to be when i grow up. people are all about ""find your passion"". nope, never really did, but i did find things i was good at and i've quite a happy, sane life. you could try magic mushrooms or ketamine ... i did many times, just for yucks -- never made a bit of difference to my mood (back then, no one knew that they could), but had some good times. main point is, ellis allowed me to stop putting expectations or conditions on what i did, i just did stuff, tried to help out my coworkers/business/customers. just focused on that so performed well and other stuff just happened because of that -- promotion  -- was managing 100 people at one point -- many i hated that, but i wasn't depressed, just good old ""this sucks, but whatever"", so i shed people and switched things up until i liked it better.

i stumbled into doing startups. some went pretty well, so i'm a late blooming ""success"" -- and it's fine, but i was ok before that. people say. ""oh you love what you do"" but no, i just do what i do and have become good at some things. i was just offered the ceo ship of a hot company. i said ""no thanks"" ... i'm just too old to generate the effort that i know is required ... but i was putting in that kind of effort in the past and it was good -- total involvement meant no time to be unhappy, we were conquering the world! i must say, doing business has led me to all kinds of interesting situations from getting personally sued by a multi-billion dollar company (made the news) to meeting billionaires at davos and flying on their jets, to raising money just 2 weeks before we ran out when my co-founder's kid got cancer. it's been a time. none of it planned, no super goal in life, but a kind of curiosity.

so, if you never know what you want to do in life ... well, neither did i, you don't have to. but, just try stuff and work hard when you have it, but change if you don't. i'd say, don't do stupid stuff, but also trust yourself to handle whatever while not expecting too much. it is a kind of zen state that's led to a pretty happy life. zuck wanted me early, turned him down (that was about $100m mistake, but really ""meh"", i've done pretty well in other things and have long since lost my passion for just making money). i sort of hang out a bunch with researchers at a university since i'm in a friend's startup and they use the products and i just like helping out. one of my key points of living a good life is, i just started being interested in other people, talking to them and that led to a wide network that led to everything else -- businesses, international talks, now university stuff. it just happens, but i'm also ok with stuff not happening. i've also been fired a couple of times. i do like talking with people and i do try to be of use ... but i'm also ok now saying no or not being of use.

i've long since gained the ability not to listen or believe my brain. i've had depression peak up now and again, and i've had things happen that would depress people (for instance, loud ringing in my ears once i turned 60 -- but albert ellis <i actually met him twice>, i just sort of let it go, now it doesn't bother me/hardly notice it). so, i've become a ""pro"". randomly a depressive thought comes up, but i'm so unimpressed with it, i just sort of let it run off like rain. 99% of the time i'm good. so, maybe just choose something not to crazy to do and do it. it may very well be a big ""mistake"", so be a guy who makes mistakes. often it's a ""meh"" thing to do, but do it and talk to people -- leads to something else. my brother-in-law is a laid back accountant guy, never liked the subject, but he likes hearing people's stories. he ended up running his own firm of about 30 people and knows everyone in town. i'd just encourage you to let your brain flap in the wind while you get on with things. if you don't know what to do, do what you are doing but harder. in 5 years you may be doing something else or not. i would say, you could aim for independence -- run your own firm. i tended to like being in charge better than working for big firms, but i had a sucky sucky corporate job in a huge corp and i was kind of shocked that i was pretty damn happy. i knew i was going to get out of there, but i was in no hurry (had a huge mortgage), but i took a calculated risk in a couple years and it worked out, but i was ok if it didn't work out. they wanted me back and i figured i'd go back and try again with something else but ended up not having to. zen/stoic/chill.",Comment,Neutral

Stanford University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stanford University /comments/zklcmw/i_hate_Stanford University _with_a_passion/,"hey man, i get what you're going through... you're not the first person to realize they wanted to go into banking or finance and felt upset others were way ahead of them... happened to me. i managed to get in, and you will too. and if you're like me, you'll realize it's not a fun career and you'll do something else after (or instead). most (if not all) of the kids that chase money are going to end up sad, upset, and disillusioned in life... so they'll come back to do a grad degree to find something that they're more ""passionate"" about. 

spoiler alert: pursue what brings you energy and you'll have a happier life. it's rarely lbo models. that goes for what you're studying. is there anything you're excited about or interested in? if not, just ride this through while you find it.

internships: if you're still set on banking, the good thing is you're a junior, and if you do a co-term you've got 2 internships for the future. even without a co-term, you can do an internship next summer even if you graduate. talk to your profs! especially those in economics or business - they can warm intro you to bankers. reach out to spif (Stanford University  professionals in investment & finance), and become a student member. network, aim for boutique firms or finance research to get your foot in the door, don't waste your time recruiting for the big banks yet. dm me if you're really lost and don't know how to start. time is on your side, and you have more flexibility than you even realize. so give yourself some grace.

good news: Stanford University  undergrads are wanted in finance, and there's a huge network of professionals that want to help. it's a slog to talk to them, but don't despair because it's what everyone goes through. they just don't talk about how hard it is... and some people come from families where banking is a thing... but it is always difficult.

also btw: finance is a cut throat industry where people chase money and work their lives away. if Stanford University  is tough to swallow, wait till you meet your managing director who spends his vacations on client calls and expects you to work till 1am. that said, it's a great place to learn and cut your teeth, and it'll help build a nest egg (if you don't spend it on stupid shit, which bankers are wont to do).

remember: it's still easier for you than it is for thousands of other people (if not millions). \*thinks back to the indian finance professionals conference i randomly registered for...i'm not desi\*

caps: everyone's struggling at Stanford University , they just don't show it. caps is overwhelmed and understaffed and left me to fend for myself. had to find friends - sucks you're not happy with yours...there are good people on campus.

big picture: breathe. i hope this doesn't sound pedantic or condescending, but it will be okay. and it does get better. if it does sound condescending, sorry - you'll understand when you get through this. from experience: try meditating, or find an undergrad or even better hang out at the gsb and find someone to talk to. grad students are super grounding, and gsb'ers are friendly. just say ""i'm an undergrad - can i ask you some questions?""

in my time: i spent undergrad feeling hopeless and stressed and i was always working. looking back now, i wasted a lot of time worrying - the worrying didn't help me achieve anything, it just got in the way of enjoying the time i was in undergrad.

it gets better. it does all start with your own attitude. keep your chin up. you're not alone.

for internships, it s really really challenging and competitive  during your freshman year i recommend talking to a lot of upperclassmen about how they applied for and got internships, and ask them what their internship experience was like. also talk to a lot of alumni about how they got their jobs and what their jobs are like. students are busy so i recommend offering to buy them a coffee or meet up for a meal, start with people you already know (ras, people in classes, tas). for alumni, use the alumni directory or linkedin, cold emailing/contacting usually works if you write a good intro about yourself and what specifically you want to talk to them about.",Comment,Neutral

i'd first read the book: ""a new guide to rational living"" by albert ellis, he was a founder of cognitive therapy and it's just kind of a ""users manual"" for your brain. you might be getting a bit depressed and this can help and learning it over and over will help over your lifetime -- it allowed me to stand stress and risk etc.  then, you can in fact reconsider where you go. nothing stops you from taking a gap year -- i used to love israeli students because they had all been in the army for a couple of years. so they came in more mature, had seen hard physical work, had forced learned team work and bonding with others and were much more focused on school and learning. you can get that in a gap year or two. if you got in Stanford University , you can easily get in a dozen other places maybe with scholarships. you could research them better. if they ask why you wanted to switch, just say ""a family emergency made me take some time off and shifted my focus to the kind of school environment your school offers"". refuse to elaborate""it was a private matter"".

i very much enjoyed my time at Stanford University  as a queer guy, but i do have one thing i tell people that come here about the so-called acceptance that west coast people preach:

if your religion is an important part of your identity, you will find more acceptance almost anywhere else. i truly think my atheism contributed to my time at Stanford University  being so fun. i've never found a community outside of the bay where condescension towards religion was more socially acceptable. conversely my catholic friends were able to create an amazing little community within themselves, but frankly, the number of time i was hanging out with them and they had to shrug off some aggressive joke about how retarded christianity is (typically from some rando that didn't know about their religion but was just assuming they were also atheist) was probably higher than you would expect even at most universities. 

religious considerations aside, about your experience with a homophobic friend: i'm sorry, but that could have happened anywhere. you say he also got expelled. what more do you want to have happened? ime ""the gays"" at Stanford University  are simply well-integrated into the community...the disproportionately high density of queer people i knew were scattered regularly throughout friend groups....almost as if they were just normal people xd. which i liked. but if you're looking for a thriving community celebrating queerness for the sake of it then i'm sure there are many places better suited for that than Stanford University ...

i don't know what lgbt even you went to, but if you had the guts to start complaining about what you're saying happened (and it really happened that way, i mean op the way you phrase things really sets off red flags for some reason, i'll be honest),  i'm sure literally any rando would be on your side...",Comment,Positive

i will also say that joining groups made my college years fun. i was in a sorority, one that didn't haze lol, and i thoroughly enjoyed it and made lots of friends. i also took some acting classes, randomly, as i had no desire or plans to act, and i made some fun friends there too.

because i'd made friends out of my sorority right off the bat, it took the pressure off of needing to make friends out of my dorm mates. my first semester dorm mate was aggressively judgemental, but she ended up moving home after the first semester bc she wasn't happy and didn't make friends. some of the other girls in the dorms were a bit hot and cold, on off friendly, our ra was weird, but my point is i didn't need them bc i was making friends elsewhere. and i was dating. we did all become friends in the end, and i got a new dorm mate who i'm still friends with 20 years later. so there is hope if you choose to stay put! you just have to move around in different circles, and decide to feel confident and cool about yourself with out needing any proof from anyone else. if you're uber friendly, be uber friendly and like that about yourself! ! some ppl will value that! but of course don't stay anywhere you feel unsafe or unhappy.",Comment,Positive

2. let as many who want to start the program, then weed them out so that many fewer are allowed to continue past freshman (or possibly sophomore) year and complete the program.

University of California Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tyrb76/warning_to_incoming_students_uc_berkeleys_cs/,"many campuses have issues with demand completely outstripping an institution's ability to offer cs curriculum.  and yes, one of the solutions could include liMassachusetts Institute of Technologying the number of majors going forward.

that said, a few concerns about the way this post has been framed.  

first of all, ""verge of collapse"" is an overly strong way to characterize it.  do we believe that a flagship campus like University of California Berkeley would just stop having a department in one of the hottest areas of stem?

second, we need to recognize where the author of the letter is coming from--their motivations and their perspective.  if you read the article, you can see that it was subMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted by a lecturer.  i know that distinction doesn't mean much to people who aren't in higher ed, but a lecturer is a member of the instructional faculty who typically focuses on teaching.  it is an important role but on most campuses, a lecturer by design has minimal duties related to department governance, finances, hiring, and long-term planning.  i am not disrespecting the role; i am married to someone who has this very same title.  so i take to heart the frustrations experienced with burnout and concern over the future, but i pause (and so should you) at the way this is being framed almost entirely as a problem rooted in budget and that berkeley is merely *unwilling* to find the money to properly fund the department and hire more faculty.  

in fact, computer science departments with money to burn are *also* facing challenges--one of which is being able to find faculty in a competitive market because (a) other campuses are also trying to hire and (b) industry is gobbling up tech-minded academics right and left.  they also need to problem-solve on issues like having offices to put them in--you need more than just money to do that; you may also need time for construction or renovations.   if you're a cs applicant you may be like ""well ffs featofclay that still sounds like a pretty big problem"" and yes it is.  but we should be careful about where we lay the blame.

the issues are real.  but what one understandably frustrated and overworked lecturer says in a complaint to the student paper may not, in fact, be fully and accurately characterizing either the problem or the solutions that a particular campus is working on.  that's what i'm saying.  and you should remember this because when you get to campus you will find other letters/articles telling you exactly why your campus is a horrible place, and you need to be able to read those critically and try to separate the truth of them from the part that is speculative.  

the value of this post is real, because any prospective cs major should be prepared for how issues of high student demand may impact their experience, and they would do well to hear from current students about what they're living through.   preferably multiple current students, and experiences and honesty do vary.  if you have concerns based on what you hear, then you may want to find out more about the institution's future plans for addressing the crunch.  if concerns remain, maybe that campus should be a little further down your list.",Comment,Neutral

University of California Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tyrb76/warning_to_incoming_students_uc_berkeleys_cs/,"observation: this is a problem with the financial model of universities which have stopped being public goods and started being extractive financial institutions.  


the current tuition at berkeley is (in round numbers) $5000/quarter in-state and $10000 per quarter out of state.


  
assuming a student takes 5 classes per quarter, the student is paying either $1000 or $2000 per class. allowing the department only $150 or $200 of that says at least 80% of the money is flowing other than to teaching. what's wrong with this model? (yes i understand financial aid as discounts, and that seats at universities are being sold in pricing models reminiscent of airline seats. my point holds. the vast majority of tuition is going somewhere other than to fund instruction.)


  
oh, and the revenue side of the business is driving customers to that department to maximize marginal revenue. there is a disconnect between the revenue strategy and the funding of fulfillment. i support changing the reward model so the university president and next two levels of administrators, as well as the university cfo, lose their jobs if they make their numbers in this way.


  
concur that tenure can get in the way. when my daughter was an undergrad at another uc campus 6-10 years ago, there were tenured faculty in her major department who were simply unsatisfactory at teaching, while the best teachers were contract people paid peanuts who were deliberately not invited back. but that's secondary. the primary problem is a financial model which emphasizes revenue and starves instruction.",Comment,Neutral

University of California Berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1afz2m/cs_and_eecs_majors_how_is_it/,"in the absence of significant experience, here are some class-specific comments. (for context, i took 61a and 61b last semester, and am taking 61c, 170, 188 this semester.)

* both 170 and 188 build on the algorithms you learn in 61b (and presumably the material in 70, which i haven't taken) -- dfs, bfs, dijkstra, minimax, and alpha-beta pruning are important ones, to name a few from the ones we've covered so far. 
* i'm finding that 170 is significantly harder than 61b (with hilfinger), but i can't compare it to 70 (which i haven't taken). i think this may be because of the greater emphasis on theory; there is just about no coding, unless you count writing out pseudocode. (maybe i'm just bad at thinking about algorithms; my upper div math and stat classes aren't as difficult.)
* so far, 188's assignments are only slightly more difficult than 61a assignments (after all, denero played a key part in the assignments for both), but the exams are more tricky than 61a exams. hilfinger's 61b was harder in both aspects.

i think it is fair to say that 61abc/70/20n/40 are a foundation for what you learn in upper div/grad classes, and so you may indeed find that they cover the lower div material in more depth, but that doesn't mean that they will be about the same difficulty. your mileage may vary from course to course (and perhaps from professor to professor).

i have heard that ee 120, for example, is mostly an extension to ee 20n, covering very similar material in more depth, and so the learning curve isn't too steep. but cs 164 could be seen as an extension of the programming language concepts in 61a, yet it is consistently viewed as one of the hardest and most time-consuming upper div cs courses. so i don't think you can usefully generalize the difficulty or workload of the upper div classes.

1) no, you don t need to be in greek life for party access. for first years, there s a lot of frat parties that happen within the first month of the semester that cater towards the new students. there s also some parties that happen at co-ops typically open to most folks. and most clubs outside of frats have kickbacks and parties for their gen members. 

2) it depends how well you manage your time and what department(s) you re in. some majors can be more stressful/competitive than others. some people typically are more stressed out than others. but tbh, it s a part of berkeley culture (idk why) to be complaining and nagging all the time about how little sleep you get, how little meals you eat in a day, and how little time you have for anything. self-care is important dude and possible to achieve here if you re proactive about it. 

3) your social life is what you make it, not your housing (but it can have some impact for your 1st year). i hated the dorms and found all my friends in clubs when i was a frosh, so i m pretty happy to be in an apt now. if you re close to campus, it s more easy to go out than if you weren t tho

4) some are more competitive than others. someone here already answered it about the consulting, business, cs ones. but there s a lot of identity-based, political, social, community service, adventure-related, music-related, etc clubs here that don t rely on apps.

5) tbh, it s not that bad at all lol i think people overexaggerate too much about it. there s not one every week if that s what you re thinking. they re pretty scattered with majority being small.",Comment,Neutral

club applications: the clubs that will benefit you professionally are impossible to get into (somewhat). consulting clubs are a nightmare. business clubs are also just as hard. cs clubs also are ridiculously hard to get into. even good dance clubs are hard to get into. however, there are clubs that aren t all about professional development. since they don t appeal to a lot of the students, they are easier to get into.

stress culture: i can see the stress culture here but just don t take too many technical classes that you know you can t handle. i don t have that much stress because my time management is above average. more stress comes from bad time management.

political protests: yup they do exist and it is annoying in my opinion. i am an out of state student so i pay more than the average in state. i pay for my education. i don t pay to witness someone rallying about our next supreme court judge. i just see it as a way of utilizing berkeley s name as a political weapon. i am all for freedom of speech and all that but i feel like just don t do it on campus. campus is a place to learn. with that being said. protests of huge magnitude are rare but they do have the highest chance of occurring out of all schools i would suppose.  overall it is not a big problem. it is a factor i would consider.",Comment,Neutral

i didn't join any clubs, wasn't in a frat or co-op, and only lived in the dorms for one year and i had no problem making friends and finding people with common interest, and i'm rather introverted.

it's pretty stressful, but i found that kind of a relief... there isn't the pressure to party every night because people really do care about their grades (i can't speak for everyone though).

i never found the politics to be distracting, but the climate wasn't the same a decade ago. it is, however, very pc. that said, the republican club is the biggest club on campus (or was at one point). it's not like a liberal arts college... it has its conservative elements.

this may sound kind of silly, but a lot of different student org's will have parties with their members, even if they're not expressly social orgs. freshman year i joined a singing group here, and after performances we would go to parties with students from all of the different singing / a cappella groups. i have friends involved in orgs like robo-sub who have gone to parties within their orgs. so joining some orgs will open you up to more party opportunities.

we also have a sizable greek life scene here, and between all the greek orgs there's usually a couple or more parties each weekend.

one thing to note - many parties here (including in greek life) aren't huge ragers with hundreds and hundreds of people coming through, and that's something a lot of students prefer. if you want bigger experiences like that, you can always try walking down forbes and finding some pitt parties to go to.",Comment,Neutral

Carnegie Mellon University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Carnegie Mellon University/comments/u85vn5/do_you_think_that_Carnegie Mellon University_is_becoming_a_degree_mill/,"tl;dr - it's a racket, but that does not mean that it's a racket.

i'm going to be a bit direct, re: china, india, immigration, and the tech industry, but hopefully in an objective way. as background, i've done my undergrad at an indian university, and ta'ed both there and as a phd student at Carnegie Mellon University.

1. there's lots of demand for good software engineers. there's a reason good engineers are making 200k in cash + stocks out of school.
2. there's a lot of ""raw talent"" in india and china. the situation in india is especially skewed - a million students apply for engineering entrance exams everywhere, and about 20,000 get into schools that are considered good. 98% don't get access to top-tier education, because it's a developing country and ""spaces of excellence"" are still being created. but slice it any which way, the next percentiles 90 to 98 are probably excellent at fundamentals by any metric, and could do any job with the proper training. i'd imagine that something like this holds true for china too, but things are probably not as skewed.
3. Carnegie Mellon University's sticker price is expensive - especially for undergrads who have to pay for 4 years' worth, vs ms students who have to pay 1.5 years' worth. it's an open secret among anyone who knows anything about college finances that ms students cross-subsidize undergrads - former are not eligible for financial aid, latter are. (and college inflation trackers fail to account for this).

so it's a win-win-win. as long as the ms students are able to attract the same kind of job offers (proving their worth), everyone gets access to what they need - talent, funds, and opportunities respectively. ""brand being diluted"" sounds like something meaningful, but it's just syntactic sugar over gatekeeping access to something that's not zero-sum, no offense :).",Comment,Neutral

is there some programs that are harder and more competitive than others (true mcs..etc)? sure, and those people should get the respect they deserve.

however, most masters within scs rarely have above a 10% acceptance rate which is low as fuck. and i have yet to take a class here that hasn't required blood, sweat, and tears.

i know people in scs sometimes hate on other programs here, heinz etc..but honestly to their defense, their stuff is still probably more challenging than many other schools in the country. and i've seen countless people from those program go on to get software engineering jobs at faangs.

on a separate note, i always thought it was really cool how Carnegie Mellon University has so many different undergrad/grad programs under scs. i always thought that's kind of unique and cool.",Comment,Positive

so yeah, i think that master programs have become something of a degree mill. and from what i've heard this isn't just at Carnegie Mellon University, it's happening all over the country. international students pay a boatload of money to get masters degrees in the us, and schools accept them with little regard for the strength of the students.

keep up with the work, talk honestly you your profs and tas. there are also mental health services that i highly recommend you utilize.

i graduated but didn t get into grad school. i wandered around a bit and also got interested in computers, taught myself (with help from my Carnegie Mellon University social network loaning me books) a portion of what a cs student would know and turned that into a successful career.

malcolm gladwell s revisionist history podcast has a two episode arc on what is measured vs what matters - kind of about law school admissions but applicable here. net sometimes the way school admissions or a path is structured isn t aligned with what it actually takes to be successful. in the lsat example - law school admission prioritized the lsat which is about speed. and that is a predictor for success as a first year law student but not success or aptitude as a lawyer as the skill sets are often different. in the actual law - details and deeper thinking often trump speed. 

so for your situation - to do math at a high level as a career, the speed with which you get new concepts each semester isn t necessarily the most important thing. it is likely more about if you get it eventually, your engagement and your resilience when you are in the messy middle of figuring things out. 

i think the two episodes are called puzzle rush and the tortoise and the hare. 

truly liking the subject and how demanding it is, being willing and able to collaborate with others and seek help - these are traits that can lead to career success in the field - because they are signs you are willing to do the work and to stick with it when the going is tough. 

i have watched brilliant people flame out in the  real world  bc they lacked the resilience and passion to persist and watched a lot of folks who may not have been as academically gifted succeed bc they brought something beyond smarts to the table. the reality is that baseline smarts are needed to put you in the pool of folks. and i bet you have that or Carnegie Mellon University wouldn t have taken you.  once you have met the threshold of good enough then it is about the work and brilliance doesn t always win the day in the real world. in fact, sometimes it can get in the way bc it can liMassachusetts Institute of Technology how much you build / focus on other skills including interpersonal skills, work habits, learning how to navigate feeling stuck and how to leverage available resources to get unstuck. 

so while you certainly should prioritize mental health, i urge you to consider if it is the work harming it or the habit of comparison.  comparison is the thief of joy  may apply here, if you love the subject and challenging courses . and also there is no harm in looking at course selection. you can have courses that are challenging for you and build your skills appropriately sometimes without always aiming for the hardest of everything. consider talking to some of the profs who help you about the challenge - you love the work and the challenge of it but are just a bit slower to grasp it sometimes - may help them recommend classes that hit your sweet spot. or they could tell you you are doing better than you think. it is a good way to open the door to a bit more of a relationship with them.  teachers like students who love their subjects.

Carnegie Mellon University definitely has a stress culture around it across most/all programs, but one that is often overstated. the academic focus is also one of the things that really brings the whole student community together, which is something most students and i really value about Carnegie Mellon University.

architecture is probably one of the most (if not the most) stressful, demanding programs here, but i think a lot that is very inherent in how all architecture programs are structured. in particular, (from what i've heard) your future as an architect is basically up to the discretion of your professors, and so professors can be very demanding of students, students have to compete with each other to intern with their profs over the summer, and so on. again, this is something unique to the architecture program; this isn't true for most if not all other programs at Carnegie Mellon University, but it is true for architecture programs at other schools.

another thing i'll add. i wouldn't say there is a ""stress culture"" here. sure there's a lot of work, but having come from a very competitive and toxic high school (if you're from texas, you might have heard of plano west), i can say that i have been pleasantly surprised at how open the people here are. no one wants you to fail or do worse. everyone is willing to help everyone else, which makes the work a lot more bearable imo.

Princeton University ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Princeton University /comments/fa116f/Princeton University _experience/,"congratulations on getting matched with Princeton University ! i am currently an engineering student  there (not aerospace specifically though)and can give you some broad input on the experience. the community among engineers is actually really close-knit because of the amount of collaboration that is encouraged on assignments. one thing to be weary about is that students often feel pressured to be productive all the time, which can be unhealthy and unrealistic, and makes people lose perspective of life outside the orange bubble. engineering here tends to be more theoretical, but there are definitely opportunities to do hands-on work through some classes and senior projects. 

having been in an eating club and being independent (not on any meal plan), i would say there are pros and cons to both and the decision really depends on a person's personality and priorities. eating clubs can provide a solid social scene if you already have a lot of friends in your club (this applies to both bicker and sign-in clubs from what i've heard), but being independent is much better financially, allows you to be more flexible in where you eat (you'll be more likely to try out all the great restaurants around town), and pushes you to be more intentional about your friendships through one-on-one meals if that's what you want. while there is a divide between eating clubs and the rest of campus, i actually enjoy knowing that i am eating with friends who are actively choosing to eat with me now as an independent, even though i don't see all of my friends from my old eating club as much anymore.

the really unhappy people i saw at Princeton University  generally fell into two groups. one group had preexisting mental health issues that were exacerbated by the stress of being on campus, or they were really invested in entering the more  exclusive  segments of campus life (bicker eating clubs, dance groups, etc) and got worn down by rejection. some people fell into both groups. 

i think the keys to being happy on campus - and honestly, probably just being happy in life) are: building/finding a community of people who like you for you, developing healthy coping mechanisms for stress/depression (aka going to see someone at the health center, exercising, getting enough sleep, talking to your friends etc), and filling your days with activities that you are inherently interested in, as opposed to things that you feel you need to do in order to impress people or check off a box on a to-do list.",Comment,Positive

*20 phd here. i wasn t in cs but had friends who were (both phd and masters students). no need to worry about how masters students are treated compared to phd students. there isn t a pecking order like you re describing. that s just your imposter syndrome whispering doubt in your head. we all have it. try to tell it to shut the fuck up. 

as for advisor horror stories, that kind of relationship is going to be hit and miss anywhere you go. do your due diligence when you re applying to grad school. if you re invited on campus visits, ask the grad students you meet to lay the cards plainly on the table about the pros and cons of the program, the faculty, and the social life. grad school is hard. it s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows anywhere you go. it s better to be armed with realistic expectations than a false sense of security. 

as for why Princeton University    again, i wasn t in cs, so i can t speak to the minutiae of department culture. that being said, i do know that Princeton University  stands apart from peer institutions (e.g. Harvard University and Stanford University ) in cs that it pays its masters students. **this is huge.** there is so much to be said for the impact financial security (or lack thereof) has on our mental health. Princeton University  pays its students very well, and as a masters student you re basically guaranteed to live in campus housing (below market value) while you re there. i pinched pennies, but i was actually able to save money while in grad school. if you find yourself in a situation where you re choosing between multiple programs, unless you re independently wealthy, **whether or not you get paid should be a major deciding factor.**
 
cons about Princeton University : it s a sleepy town. the orange bubble is real and can be a real drag at times. as a grad student you ll always feel second chair to the undergrads. we all know Princeton University  is primarily and undergraduate institution coming in, but i don t think it really hit how comparatively under-supported grad students are treated by the administration. at the end of the day, though, it s still Princeton University . our lot as grad students is still much better than at other schools (which the faculty/admins so persistently remind us whenever we gripe).

1) sort of but not really. yeah, you may not get told about important things, but more or less you are treated like a phd student. the only thing is that you don't have a room in the building. ta training and orientation, etc. is held jointly with the phd students. we're basically all the same.

2) yes, it definitely is! i'm involved with research now; most of the masters' students are more into the courses and a light thesis, but if you want to get really involved, finding an advisor who is experienced and would be fine with you diving headfirst into a master's thesis will be possible. raships are exclusively for phd students insofar as all mse students must do 4 semesters of taing. however, we are not precluded from pursuing research (but we aren't really encouraged, either -- it's entirely you're prerogative).

3) meh. not very social imo. i am american and while i share heritage with a lot of the international graduate students, i find that they stick together and tend to exclude americans from their events. again, that's on them, but it's hard to be social in my experience unless you spend a lot of time going to external events like gsg parties, game nights, etc. making friends is harder in graduate school in general, though. it's not like undergrad, but this is more reflective of Princeton University  as a whole.

4) yeah, we don't have strong unionizations here unfortunately. there are both graduate student groups vying for and against unionization, and you can find both of them at the club fair during orientation, etc. pretty weird haha. the administration really cares for their undergrads, but grad students aren't treated as well as the undergrads are. you have to put a lot of effort to find out the details -- like club fair, etc. also the actual graduate school is fine with replying to emails about important things (e.g. the dean personally replied to my email about the graduate tax waiver earlier this year), but the cs department is notoriously bad at handling administrative issues (the dgs, etc.). Princeton University  is ""liberal"" relative to most places, but they are in the ""traditional/classical"" school of liberalism. they're really resistant to changing their traditions despite being a liberal community. kind of sucks sometimes. this culture will become obvious when you spend more time here.

5) yeah, it's not as strong of a political climate as, say, berkeley or something. but people do get involved and they do have events! there is a gun reform rally now, there was a graduate tax waiver protest earlier this year, and a bunch of us got together and organized a political day to call our senators about daca repealing in the fall, etc. so you can definitely get involved politically, but it may be harder to find than you think. for a small campus, finding the niche communities serving interest groups is surprisingly challenging.

6) Princeton University  is beautiful, but i think in terms of social culture i strongly preferred my undergraduate school. in terms of academic culture, it's amazing here and they really do a good job at making sure you don't stress out too much -- my graduate classes were super flexible with everything since they know that we are busy with other work (research, taing, etc.). let me know if you have other questions!

again, i m not a cs kid, but our department offers a lot of classes - check out registrar.Princeton University .edu/course-offerings to see what s being offered.

i m a stem major with a humanities side, so i love Princeton University  s offerings in that respect, and all my friends are studying completely different things, which is interesting.

i don t know how research works at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but it s very easy at a Princeton University , with most students writing a senior thesis (and those few who aren t required to typically still do some).

eating clubs really aren t that bad. about half are non-selective and are completely unproblematic, 2 are selective but about as inoffensive as possible, and the remaining 4 selective ones are occasionally problematic, but are about 10 times better than most frats (and they re all co-ed). eating clubs are imperfect, but are a much better social center than what s at many other schools.

Princeton University  places you in a completely random dorm freshman year, but you have a room draw to pick your room for sophomore year (although you can t switch res colleges, so you re liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed to the buildings within yours). as an upperclassman you have room draw but can choose to live anywhere open to upperclassmen.

i was worried that the town of Princeton University  might not be as fun as a city, but it s never been a problem. the town has several streets full of shops and restaurants that are more than enough for most occasions - you re on a dining plan, so it s not like there s a need to eat out that often. on the weekends there s a shuttle to the nearest mall/grocery store/target for anything else you need. if you want to go into a big city for a day/weekend philly and nyc are easily accessible by train.

last year i went into nyc and philly like 2 or 3 times each, and would seldom go more than 3 blocks from campus. there s usually no need - there are dozens of events every day on campus, there are parties on the street, and there are clubs and other extracurriculars to occupy you.

on the opposite extreme, i have a good friend at New York University who loves being in the city, but seems to not really have much of a connection to campus community and just spends all day in the city. i also know people at Cornell University in the middle of nowhere who are confined to the town. i think Princeton University  s location offers everything i need, and living in a city would remove the focus on the campus community, but at the end of the day it s not too different from how Massachusetts Institute of Technology is situated - in both cases not crazy urban, but not entirely isolated.",Comment,Neutral

regarding the cos department, (yeah it s not cs at Princeton University  for some weird reason) it might be true that the classes are not as expansive as Massachusetts Institute of Technology but Princeton University  offers some pretty good classes for undergrad. i don t think you will find it lacking. the campus recruiting for cs is also pretty good. you also get to work on a thesis with some prof if that s of interest to you. i can t imagine you will be able to do research guided by a prof at Massachusetts Institute of Technology unless you re really pro active.

edit: another caveat is if you plan to get a masters or phd, Massachusetts Institute of Technology can be the next choice for sure. at least then you will have gone to two different schools and experienced both.

tldr: i chose Princeton University  given the same choice and i would do it again!",Comment,Positive

i graduated from Princeton University  in cs \~10 years ago (and work at an ai lab today), so my perspective (benefitting from some perspective but also a bit dated) may or may not be helpful:

on your list of Princeton University 's cons:

* on suburban location: fully agree that Princeton University 's location is beautiful and bucolic but also kinda boring relative to cambridge (i lived in boston/cambridge after i graduated). only thing i'd say is that most of my Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Harvard University friends were so bogged down that they didn't really do much in town anyway (bit less true if you join the Massachusetts Institute of Technology frats i think).
* preppy and elitist: preppy element existed at Princeton University  but nerdy/collaborative one was far bigger, esp in cs.
* cs program not as expansive as Massachusetts Institute of Technology's: agreed, but tbh, once you're in a very good cs program (\~top 10), you're not going to be lacking for course options at the undergrad level (very different for phd candidates, obviously!). ten years ago, a bigger factor may have been that there wasn't a critical mass of cs majors (\~35 of us iirc) but now cs is the biggest major on campus.
* eating clubs: i'm not a fan of the eating club model either frankly but this didn't affect my time at Princeton University  very much. i went to them when my friends hung out at them (the club depended on the group of friends) to eat or socialise, but otherwise didn't take much mental energy. my junior year, i joined a sign in club with friends, my senior year, i left to join a coop with some other friends (and absolutely loved that experience!)

i loved my nerdy Princeton University  cs experience combined with the weird, varied, and eclectic interests of my friends, and i'd do it over again without a doubt.

a few other things that may be worth  keeping in mind:

* Princeton University  felt a lot more social to me than Massachusetts Institute of Technology (when i visited friends there). i got the sense that at Massachusetts Institute of Technology you formed lasting bonds with the people in your friend group or dorm but Princeton University  was the sort of place where you could sit down more or less next to anyone in your dining hall and have long, windy, funny dinnertime conversation for hours.
* most college experiences are 4 year affairs. Princeton University  is for life: it's a very strong alumni community bonded by a lot of school spirit.

happy to chat more if helpful, and good luck! Princeton University  is obviously close to my heart but Massachusetts Institute of Technology's an amazing school and wish you the best wherever you go.",Comment,Neutral

(i used to help recruit for microsoft, and have many friends who do the same for the faang). 

my ex-gf went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology for grad school, which caused me to move to boston for a bit and i got to watch the undergrad culture from afar. you should know that, at least through 2009, there was a popular acronym at Massachusetts Institute of Technology: ihtfp -> i hate this fucking place. it s not all unicorns and rainbows (neither is Princeton University  if we re being honest). the culture was definitely very nerdy, which was both good and bad.

eating clubs have some issues, but it s no different from Harvard University s clubs (and it s much better than heavy greek life, as found at most other universities). a few are elitist and not very diverse (in race/wealth), and a few are very rowdy and frat-like, but there are several that are non-selective (if there s room, anyone who applies gets in, and if not, there s a lottery system), and are pretty diverse and unproblematic. just join one with your friends (or don t, if you re happy in the dining halls/as an independent), and it will serve as a place to eat and party and socialize.

Princeton University  and Harvard University are very similar in terms of layperson prestige in the us, although Harvard University has a slight edge there. the most popular college ranking, us news and world report, has Princeton University  as number 1 though. what really matters though is how it s perceived by employers and by other universities, and they consider it equal to Harvard University.

Princeton University  has the largest endowment of any university in the country per student (Harvard University s endowment is larger, but they have many more students). the undergrad focus thing is real - Princeton University  s lack of professional schools (law, medicine, etc.) means the community is a better size and you re more important to the administration and to faculty.",Comment,Neutral

Princeton University  itself does throw one school ball in the fall, but the bigger events are the lawn parties. these are campus-wide darties that last a whole day one day each semester usually right before reading period. whether or not you're into partying, it's a great time to just have fun with friends.

Princeton University ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Princeton University /comments/ttqwim/Princeton University _cs_vs_Columbia University_cs/,"what i would recommend would depend on what you re looking for in a school.

this egleston scholar program seems like a hard deal to pass up, especially if you re into cs research. but here s a couple things to consider for Princeton University .

Princeton University  s junior paper and thesis programs are intentionally built with faculty involvement, and every student is assigned a faculty supervisor when working on their senior thesis. as long as you re a bit smart about choosing your faculty member, you ll get a lot of engagement and working relationship with them.

cs is difficult, but every major is here, because standards are high. grade deflation (the unofficial kind) is withering away here as the years go on, and cos126 (the intro cs course) has a good rep for being an excellent foundation into the other pre-req classes.

switching majors in the bse program can be a little difficult once you hit sophomore year and is basically impossible once you hit junior year. some disciplines (like from cos to cbe) are harder to make the switch to others depending on the major, but switching from cos to, say, electrical engineering is not too bad provided you ve done the engineering pre-recs in freshman year.

if you want to switch from cos to an ab major like math, it s mostly painless since some of the pre-reqs line up. really, switching majors isn t hard as long as you put in your due diligence when picking classes and when you pick them and allow yourself the flexibility to switch if you want.

as far as community at Princeton University , it is what you make of it, but it does tend to be tighter knit than at other schools like Columbia University, from what i understand. Columbia University is obviously located in nyc, and students tend to spend a lot of their free time just doing nyc stuff. on the other hand Princeton University  is, physically, not that big a school, and the only thing outside of it is suburban new jersey. so the school hosts activities and events *every day*, like speakers, and arts events. you also run into the same people often by just walking around (although not *too often*, the school is big enough that there s a little bit of anonyMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy, which i this is like the perfect size). there s also student events going on all the time, whether that s theater, cultural and athletic, academic, etc. the eating clubs make it easy to party as long as you don t obsess over trying to get into list ones, as there s basically always at least a couple open on the weekends that are open to everyone.

and i ll be blunt, Princeton University  wasn t my first choice of school. but between the financial aid, the opportunities present here, the bigger undergrad focus compared to schools like Columbia University, and the more intimate community, i ve come to enjoy my time here.

the big thing i d say is that undergraduate life at Princeton University  is very structured compared to undergraduate life at oxford. at Princeton University  you ll have multiple classes a day, some of which will be large lectures. at oxford, you ll have a handful of classes a week and they will be very small in size (like, usually 2-3 people with an instructor). at Princeton University , you ll constantly be getting graded with homework, midterms, etc whereas at oxford the only evaluations that really matter will happen at the end of the year (not counting end of term collections). at Princeton University , you ll take five classes every semester, and they ll include not only classes relevant to your major, but also distribution requirements. you ll also (probably) be expected to do a senior thesis. at oxford, you ll take two classes most trimesters and they ll all be directly related to your topic of study.

basically, oxford will give you lots of work but lots of freedom in how you handle it, and will be single-minded in your topic of study. Princeton University  will give you lots of work, but its structure will force you to spread out your learning in terms of time and also discipline via distribution requirements. both cs programs can be quite theoretical, but i found Princeton University  to have more practical coding assignments than oxford.

oxford s college life is much better than Princeton University  s residential college system imo, and oxford as a city is much livelier than Princeton University  (and well connected to london). on the other hand, Princeton University  is a secluded place to study and take in every aspect of college life, while still having great access to nyc. also, most people enjoy eating clubs, which compensate for oxford s colleges a bit.

idk what your financial situation is, but unless a) you re paying full price no matter what or b) you got really, really lucky and got a scholarship at oxford, Princeton University  will probably be way cheaper. if you are paying full price, this probably flips though, as oxford s only three years and college costs in the uk are a little lower.

i m kind of rambling, but having spent a lot of time at both of these (great!) institutions, i have lots of thoughts. i don t think you can go wrong either way though. happy to answer any specific questions you have in this thread or via pm.

regarding the value of Massachusetts Institute of Technology s cs curriculum compared to other schools, i m sure you d be able to learn similar material anywhere, even online (at least up to a certain point). i think the real value of an Massachusetts Institute of Technology education comes from the brilliant people and ideas that you d be surrounding yourself with. it s a very self selecting group of people who are all very driven and passionate about whatever they do, and this leads to a lot of intellectual curiosity that would be hard to find elsewhere at this density. it s difficult to put a number to this, and maybe it doesn t necessarily perfectly relate to some financial return on investment, but it s something to consider nonetheless.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology/comments/frct7r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology_v_brown/,"i was choosing specifically between brown and Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well. i really liked providence, was worried about the stress of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and... generally felt very similar to you, i think. i am really, really glad i chose to go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

a major thing that i didn't realize in high school was that Massachusetts Institute of Technology is significantly more blue-collar, both culturally and at its roots, than any of the ivies. Massachusetts Institute of Technology gives better financial aid on average and doesn't consider legacy status, resulting in a higher percentage of lower-middle class students. it's difficult to describe, but this fundamentally affects the social dynamics throughout the entire student body. although i definitely felt like other students were able to leverage pre-existing connections that i just didn't have in the beginning of college, i gained those connections over the years and never felt like different socio-economic backgrounds significantly affected who i socialized with. i have heard, anecdotally, that this is not the case (at least within certain parts) of the brown student body. ymmv.

another thing to consider is that, in many ways, Massachusetts Institute of Technology is an objectively higher-ranked school and has a gigantic, top-ranked graduate student body. this doesn't mean that you're necessarily going to learn more here, or get a better education here, but it does come with certain benefits, e.g. wider opportunities to do research, wider and deeper course selections (esp. in the math department), and, correctly or not, some people will think you're more impressive.

some downsides: since Massachusetts Institute of Technology attracts so many people with ridiculous pre-college backgrounds (especially in math), the learning curve for the average student is steep. introductory math courses for math majors are unnecessarily difficult because professors are catering to imo medalists who have already seen a full introductory topology syllabus before. good grades in introductory classes in general are more difficult to earn, and some premeds in particular spend a lot of time stressed about this. Massachusetts Institute of Technology does not have a medical school associated with it, but we have incredible biology labs and plenty of joint programs at Harvard University. from what i know (which isn't much), Massachusetts Institute of Technology seems to be very well set up to help students who want to do an md/phd or academic medicine sorts of careers, but might be less good for students who are dead-set on the traditional doctor route. you should see if you can find a way to talk to some current pre-meds at both schools.

it's impossible for me to say how much any of these things will matter to you, and like many others are saying, the most important thing to think about is which school you'll be happier at. Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a difficult experience for everyone, and you will hate it at least some of the time. it's important that you like it at its core, or you'll be miserable.",Comment,Neutral

i was deciding between Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and i was a bit conflicted until i went to campus preview weekend. Harvard University's was almost depressing, students were pretty meh about things, no one seemed particularly excited. Massachusetts Institute of Technology's, on the other hand, was practically a festival, with the students demonstrating their love for their school with an insane amount of effort, excitement, and love poured into projects and events. i'm guessing that's still true (or will be again once this current craziness dies down), and i think it's wonderful to be around. east campus was especially this way, but it's also pretty strongly counterculture, so your exposure to it at the school will depend largely on how you feel like you gel with that. there are some super boring, super studious dorms as well.

the parties can be pretty insane, the frat parties at least used to pull people from all over boston. people were generally surprised at how hard Massachusetts Institute of Technologyers party. the administration seems to have been clamping down on the fraternities, though, so i'm not sure if that's still true.

as for the social scene, Massachusetts Institute of Technology's residential exploration (rex) will give you time to find a good fit. even if none of the residence halls vibe with you, there's a rich variety of independent living groups and greek life. i didn't do greek life and it's still not my scene, but i'll say right off the bat that it's different from what your preconceived notions of greek life probably are (there's a rich diversity of cultures just in the fraternities).",Comment,Neutral

to address your concerns, i find that a lot of the stress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology can be self-inflicted. students will often take 5 or more classes while doing a gazillion activities. this is good in that it indicates a student body that's passionate about so many things, but it's bad in that well, people are tired and stressed. but if you single major, you can easily graduate taking 4 classes a semester (sometimes even less, if you want to study over the summer and test out of something), and that's not too bad especially if you're mindful about the classes you take. 

something i really love about Massachusetts Institute of Technology's extracurriculars is that a lot of them are beginner friendly. sans some clubs that require previous experience, most people are willing to teach you how to do things if you're willing to put in the time and learn. and since most of the students in clubs are Massachusetts Institute of Technology students, they know how hard classes and stuff can be, so they're also mindful about time comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyments. (for instance, 2 of the biggest dance groups on campus have a policy that 1 hour is the most they can require out of someone.) 

the one thing that i'd say is a downside, especially when we're comparing Massachusetts Institute of Technology to brown, is that as a stem institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology doesn't have as much humanities interest as brown would. the humanities classes we do have are great, but the departments are smaller, and you have way fewer undergrads who want to pursue the humanities. my friend, for instance, is the only anthropology major in his grade, and there's 3 21e (humanities/engineering joint major) students in my grade. as a result, if you think you're likely to pivot to something humanities related, you're not going to get a strong cohort here.

it's really awfully easy to get an inferiority complex/imposter syndrome because a lot of the people you meet are like winners of math competitions and whatnot (if you are one of these people, then the community is really nice and won't hold you back as much as elsewhere, though). heck, i was in olympiads and felt bad just because there were a lot of people who did better than me in them. a lot of these people have studied math to the extent that they will be in classes two years ahead of you when you enter since they've been looking at this stuff since the middle of high school (and sometimes earlier). but, that is fine, as long as you don't lose your motivation, you will catch up to a position you like. if you can get past this barrier and not lose confidence in yourself, you'll be fine.

for many people, the primary issue is not that the difficulty is too much per se; it's that years of this somewhat higher difficulty and feeling of inferiority really takes a toll on their motivation and people begin questioning why they wanted to study what they wanted to study in the first place. then they lose confidence in themselves and decide to go into course 6 because there they can find overwhelming comfort in money. which is a fine decision, really, money is pretty nice too.

but in either case, the earlier you come to terms with your inherent human liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys, the happier you will be. i didn't choose to major in math and physics because i wanted challenging problems; i did it because, first, i was angry at popsci articles for inadequately explaining everything and was kind of curious about what was really going on, and, more importantly, knowing math and physics makes me look \*smart and cool\*.  if i could laze around while achieving that, i definitely would lol.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology/comments/frct7r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology_v_brown/,"i think, all other things aside, the cons for Massachusetts Institute of Technology is less to worry about than the cons for brown. good cultural fit and student life are extremely important factors for me, and maybe it is for you too. it's true that at Massachusetts Institute of Technology there are some folks who take like a hundred classes per semester, but those aren't required or even the norm. i know a bunch of folks who came from schools that aren't super academically rigorous (one of whom from a rural school and had never taken a physics class) and they're still doing fine. each Massachusetts Institute of Technology degree is designed to be attainable in roughly 3 years (including general requirements) with a standard load, with the rest being optional. some people take 3 classes a semester if it'll let them graduate in time. anecdotally, i slept better through freshman year so far than i had in high school. there's also freshman pnr to help you adjust, and a number of good support systems (including your friends, s3, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology mental health) to keep you grounded.",Comment,Positive

Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology/comments/frct7r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology_v_brown/,"i m knowledgeable about both schools so let me offer a perspective that cuts against many of the comments here. 

first of all you ve asked this question in an Massachusetts Institute of Technology sub so naturally (almost) everyone is going to tell you to go to Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

my own advice, and this also incorporates the perspective of some Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty, is that you should do brown undergraduate and think about Massachusetts Institute of Technology for grad school.

brown has an excellent math department and a great applied math program. they are also one of the tops for biology.  don t kid yourself into thinking that premed at brown is a cakewalk. everyone is taking the biology courses and the chemistry courses for a grade, and they are all trying to get into great medical schools.  

you also will have more opportunities to get exposed to research and obtain publications as an undergraduate at brown than at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. because brown s graduate school is much smaller, undergraduates get more direct contact with professors and more research at the bench (yes, i m familiar with the opportunities Massachusetts Institute of Technology provides to undergraduates. one tenured faculty told member told me he expected a 50% failure rate on whether or not they ll actually even last the semester in a research program).

also consider this:

http://www.savvypremed.com/savvy-pre-med/2019/4/15/top-25-best-colleges-for-pre-meds

you will note in a number of rankings brown is listed higher than Massachusetts Institute of Technology for premed.

brown has a much more diverse student body, which i think will be good for you to get exposed to.  and yes, you can definitely find people who are going to be cranking away on a late night study session and other people who are going to be partying. greek life is much smaller at brown than Massachusetts Institute of Technology and you have other kinds of parties. 

i know the reputation that brown has as a place for celebrities to go, that is overblown.  they represent a tiny portion of the class. brown has among the highest rate of students taking financial aid in the ivy league.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in many disciplines, is number one in the world for grad school.  if you really desire the experience, you could come get a phd at tech.  you could also do the hst program md phd:

https://meded.hms.Harvard University.edu/admissions-choosing-track

critical thinking and communication skills are incredibly important and going to get more so as we see more artificial intelligence automation. by the time you graduate from medical school, ai will be doing a number of common analytic tasks.  ai will have a harder time replacing creativity, empathy, and other soft skills which frankly you are not going to be well exposed to in an undergraduate education at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

you will have the opportunity, however, if you choose to take humanities classes at brown. don t punk out and just take the premed and math tracks. take comparative literature, take english, take archaeology, take a cross listed class at risd.

finally, you are a bit handicapped because you won t get to do the preview weekends.  but see what you can do to get exposed to students at both schools. you need to find whichever one feels right for you, and that could end up being Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  in which case, go forth and conquer.

good luck!",Comment,Neutral

Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology/comments/m5g5kx/lgbtq_at_Massachusetts Institute of Technology/,"hi! 2017 alum here. there are many of us at Massachusetts Institute of Technology! some pockets of alphabet mafia seem to crop up on their own (in east side dorms like east campus and random), and there's been a push for more representation in west campus as well through an org called queer west. there are also lgbtq+ resources on campus, and iirc a lot of them are run through the rainbow lounge, which has really great people! 


generally lgbtq+ orgs and events are well-publicized if you're on the regular dormspam mailing lists, so it's pretty doable to find them. overall the vast majority of people are accepting and affirming, and there are some lgbtq+ faculty and staff who are out as well. karl surkan in wgs is great, and so is chris bourg, who is head of Massachusetts Institute of Technology libraries. 


the most common obstacle you'll run into is people not having much knowledge of the lgbtq+ community, but most people are willing to learn & grow. i'd encourage you to take a look at the admissions blogs and the various websites to get a sense of what's out there, and i'm happy to answer any questions you might have as well! if you have trouble digging up info, lmk. i'm on mobile and late crawling into work right now.",Comment,Positive

as a queer person at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, i ve actually also had the opportunity to take classes that included lgbtq+ studies, which has been super super affirming and good. i took a wonderful queer literatures class through the wgs department, and in general have met a good number of queer folks through other classes in the department. so, like in most places, the queer community does tend to be kinda localized to specific contexts, but we are most definitely here and more present than people think!

(also, i m a physics major, and i ve met a lot of queer people in the student body. definitely less representation on the administrative side, but the undergraduate side of the department is pretty queer friendly and is making a very strong effort to make Massachusetts Institute of Technology a more inclusive space).

my current gf went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and deals with serious anxiety issues that probably stem from that constant sink-or-swim environment. i know three people that had mental breakdowns after graduating upon entering the workforce. 

at least the culture isn't toxic and like others have said, it's very collaborative. very few people can manage this place on their own. i went to every single office hours that i could because on average, my friends and i could only figure out ~30% of any pset on our own.",Comment,Neutral

for me, having pnr this first semester absolutely helped the transition. i was in mostly frosh classes too so it wasn t wildly firehose if that makes sense. i did join a few clubs, and there were times i really shouldn t have procrastinated on assignments. that being said, if you re not coming in with that transition semester, it might be tougher. 

from all my interactions, and what i ve talked to some upperclassmen about, most people aren t competing grade-wise. as people have stated, the environment is meant to be collaborative. and i can second that good tas are absolute angels. you might run into a class that might have something going on that makes you dislike it, but a big thing i ve noticed being important is asking for help. 

profs, tas, classmates are (i hope at least mostly) willing to help. you re not the only one lost. a lot of people have imposter syndrome; going through it alone is what would be terrifying. my urop advisor checks in on the group i m part of to make sure that they don t have to go tell off any other profs (bless their heart). then there s s^3 and some other mental health services. not saying there s a quick fix to the stress, but there are ways to approach it!

by far the worst part is the absolute lack of food, groceries, and entertainment in the kendal square area. the closest market is brothers and is overpriced. 

the absolute best part (aside from low cost) was being right on the river. the sailing pavilion is right near the dorm so it's very easy to take advantage of it. also it is next to the campus bar. 

70 amherst is a great way to save money but it comes at a great cost: it's a dorm not an apartment. 70 amherst was an undergraduate dorm and the only change since they made it a graduate dorm is that they've painted over some of the (pornographic) murals. would i do it the same if i could do it all over again? yes.

also, i've been told by friends who live in singles in other dorms (sidpac) that on campus singles are cheaper than almost anything you will find within a reasonable distance from campus off the red line. but living with roommates off campus is cheaper than with roommates on campus. personally, i recommend living in porter square or davis square, in my four years here i've lived in both. the green line is also being extended into north somerville which may make commuting from more affordable areas easier. typically the further from the red line the cheaper.  there is a Harvard University/Massachusetts Institute of Technology housing page on facebook you should look into. it can sometimes save you from having to pay brokers fees.",Comment,Neutral

that being said, things did get better; i've found that there's a really great snowball effect to meeting people -- one you become close with one person, you'll meet some of their friends, and then some of those people's friends, and so on. and, i think you can meet people in unexpected ways -- one of the first close friends i made on campus was because i connected with them on linkedin (of all places), and i sent them a message saying hi and asking about what classes they were taking, which led to a longer conversation and eventually to us meeting up irl. this person is now one of my closest friends and i hang out with them almost every day.

in terms of balancing time, i've found that meals (dinner especially) are a great time to hang out and catch up with people since you're (usually) not working while eating. i usually enjoy working in the same room (lounge or larger dorm room) as friends as well, even if we're working on different things since we can often feed off of each other's productivity with the occasional joke or discussion here and there. also, going to floor study breaks is a good way to take a few minutes off and meet some people who live near you.

that being said Massachusetts Institute of Technology is really cool because in a lot of ways you get back what you put into it. think about the stuff you find interesting/fun/exciting and see if there are groups that engage in your interests. i did that once upon a time and while i was never the most social of butterflies i did find people who became lifelong friends. you don't need to dramatically force yourself out of your comfort zone (reddit is also a good option if you want to connect with folks more anonymously or less in person) but you may need to put yourself out there a little more to give people a chance to meet you socially. look into social groups at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in boston. see what's out there and challenge yourself to go meetings and see who's there. maybe you don't end up wanting to socialize that way but along the way you can meet one or two or more interesting folks to get to know and who can help alleviate some of the loneliness. 

what you're feeling is 100% normal, but don't let it scare you away from getting out and meeting people (especially the ones who like what you like). you will almost certainly be surprised at how cool some of the folks you meet are and how much you will have in common with some of them. just remember that if it feels like people are in too much of a rush under normal circumstances then meeting them in social situations (i.e. social group meetings) is a good way/time to catch them when they aren't rushing around dealing with all the craziness that is Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",Comment,Neutral

start by not thinking this anymore. i know it s hard, but tomorrow is unwritten for all of us.

you mention  no time for clubs, sports, etc . make some time. even an hour a week. there is so much variety out there to pick from. i d recommend something physical, as it helps reduce stress to get your mind focussed on a physical activity. here s some ideas:

run with someone

frisbee 

dancing (ballroom dance club)

musical instruments

darts

aikido or tae kwan do

boxing

for all of these and many more, there are clubs and groups that welcome everyone from beginners to olympians.

do yourself a favor and reach out blindly tomorrow towards something you think might be fun. try something. have a little adventure. what a fun way to find some friends, right?

Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology/comments/t99ih5/loneliness/,"hey, i totally feel you. i'm the same. i know the other commentors have good will in mind. but sometimes, things like joining extracurricular or social groups is just too big a jump from the normal routine. there's too much friction involved. considering the workload, rushed schedules, and a more introverted personality, i  don't want to be worrying about the dynamics in a real-life chat. it makes me anxious.

idk if this helps but my friends are building an option which reduces a lot of friction. a social-audio app that brings college students in boston together to share interesting stories, talk 1-1 through audio. the goal is to remove loneliness and build a community where every student can feel heard. sort of like you post a specific thought and someone who's keen to talk about it will call you and chat 1-1, skipping the small talk. or you can browse and call others.

they use me as one of their case studies. they r prolly launching before summer.

i told them i want on-demand convos even when i'm in the dorm. that way as compared to joining social clubs irl, i can save time and don't have to be that awkward, after all, it's voice.

with that said, voice calls can never replace irl interactions, im fully cognizant of that. but i guess with this option, it reduces a lot of friction: time, awkwardness, effort. and if we manage to hit it off, it's not too late to meet up and have dinner, it catalyzes more interactions by improving students accessibility. it will still require effort on your part to call, but it's a lot lesser than physically going to places and chatting with other students irl, which is what i've been looking for.

im not sure will this increase your hope that the future will be better bcos of more options. if not, just know that we're in this shit tgt and we're tryna solve this too.

grads seem to sing the same song: in the working society, your grades mean nothing, who you know and how you interact with others mean the world. make the best out of college.

and i've been trying to expand my social circle sincerely but i've been running into the same problems as you. sigh... im willing to put in effort but not too drastic change in routine.

college will be a lot more fun when we get on-demand convos without harassers or trollers, but just people who's looking to truly chat, exchange stories and best case scenario, make new friends. i believe in a better future in college and i hope you can hold onto that hope too.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Massachusetts Institute of Technology/comments/ledd1n/how_grueling_is_surviving_Massachusetts Institute of Technology/,"i'm currently several years into the eecs phd program, in csail. my experience seems to be very different from most other people's here.

the workload and work/life balance have been mostly up to me. if students want to get more papers published, they have to work more, and if they work less, then that's fine too but they of course won't get as much done. this is because advisors in csail outside of theoretical cs, especially tenured ones, have plenty of funding and stability, so they don't mind some students progressing faster and some slower. of course, they want to see some progress, but most students i know work 40-50 hours/week on average. advisors without tenure may on average be more likely to be hands-on and pushing to get papers out, but most don't expect you to work more than 40 hours/week.

for me, the 40 hours/week average has high variance: if there's an upcoming paper deadline, i might be working much more than that, and after a deadline, i might take a week off and not get any work done at all. over time i've become less concerned about deadlines (in most fields there's always another potential conference a few months later), so the variance has decreased.

the times when i've been most busy have always been when i was taking classes, but there are only 6 required classes in the phd program (4 tqe in eecs and 2 random related classes for the ""minor"" requirement). this matches my experience as an undergraduate: during college, i felt like there was always work that i had to be getting done, and a continuous stream of deadlines, and no matter how many problem sets / projects / exams there were, it seemed to balloon to occupy most of my time; so even on the weekends i would feel like i was very busy. as a phd student, especially when i'm not taking classes (which is most semesters), i don't feel any pressure to work during evenings or weekends, and conference submission deadlines are soft deadlines since there's always the option of subMassachusetts Institute of Technologyting a paper somewhere else. so for me it's much closer to working a regular job than being a student.

most labs do expect students to write 3 or so papers (they don't necessarily need to get them all published), so although working 40 hours/week is fine, students do need to complete three projects. this relates back to your question about difficulty: it is difficult in the sense that you will need to over time develop research skills, but not (at least for me) in the sense that you need to work 80 hours/week every week.

btw this ""it's up to you"" sentiment is something i've heard from students across several different labs/advisors in csail. so i'm pretty surprised about the other responses -- i know some fields expect much more, but perhaps in large part due to the availability of funding, it doesn't seem to be the case in csail. now, if you work at most 40 hours/week and develop research skills more slowly (which is fine), it may take you longer to get enough papers out to graduate, but if you're making decent progress then i don't know any advisor who would suddenly demand you start working 80 hours/week or something crazy like that.

note: ee and especially other fields outside eecs like biology, chemistry, etc. may be very different.

you can drop out with the sm degree, which you typically get after two years (4 semesters). i'd say it's probably not worth it to go in expecting to drop out with a master's degree. if that's your goal, i'd recommend a different university instead, for example, Carnegie Mellon University offers a very good master's program: https://csd.Carnegie Mellon University.edu/academics/masters/overview#mscsoverview",Comment,Neutral

however, it's not like it isn't rewarding. you see yourself grow so much. classes get progressively harder, but you become progressively better at handling them. freshman pnr is there to ease you in, and you have to choose which way you want to roll. if you're happy with a c, you could have a pretty chill time. if you're aiming for an a, it's going to be a constant grind. 

sometimes i feel like if i'd gone to another school, i wouldn't have to cope with so much stress and anxiety, and i would have a much better social life. but i'm honestly happy i'm at Massachusetts Institute of Technology because i really don't care about the *college experience*. that's not why i'm here; i came here to become an engineer, and that's what i'm focused on. it's just 4 years of my life, i've made friends, i've met amazing people, and i have no regrets. 

the people who are struggling the most, i feel like, are the ones who put academics second. you have to be motivated to go through the struggle; earning a c at Massachusetts Institute of Technology is hard. earning an a isn't impossible, but it's way more work than you could expect. people who do well here are the ones who put in the most work, honestly. even if there are people who are doing better because they are more experienced, you can get there with enough time and effort. the question is, are you willing to/able to put that much time and effort in.

first, the ihtfp culture can be toxic in that it pressures people to be busy and suffering, often for no good reason. if you aren't constantly ""hosed"", you should feel bad about not doing enough. if you do well on an exam, you should shut up about it, even though statistically Massachusetts Institute of Technology students do quite well on most exams. fortunately, getting out of this vicious cycle is a personal choice, one that i see more and more of my friends taking. you don't have to take seven classes just because your genius math olympiad friend is taking eight. you don't have to join a bunch of clubs just so your resume will look good in three years. once you realize how amazing an environment Massachusetts Institute of Technology is without all of the baggage, you won't have any second thoughts about those other schools.

the grade deflation is bad relative to e.g. Harvard University, but it is humbling and helps you to grow - you stop worrying about getting straight a's or whatever standard you had for yourself in high school, and instead take classes for the sake of learning. classes are hard by design, but for the most part, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. if everyone could keep up with all the classes, what would be the challenge? (i want to refer you to [this](https://Massachusetts Institute of Technologyadmissions.org/blogs/entry/surviving-Massachusetts Institute of Technology/) Massachusetts Institute of Technology admissions post. i know a lot of them can be cheesy and over-the-top but this one is worth reading before coming to campus.)

there is definitely time to go to parties and hang out with friends (on a regular basis). the Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities are the heart of boston's university party scene every weekend. even if you're not into that, Massachusetts Institute of Technology is ideally placed, close to cambridge, allston, and of course boston. go out and explore, eat great food, meet awesome people - do whatever fun things you want, because that's what college is about.

if you enjoy the classes and focus on your studies, you are already a leg up on the majority of the kids in engineering. a lot of them realize that it's not what they actually want to do, but keep going to the classes they dread and doing the work they hate.  

yes, it does get hard at times. since every kid was in the top of their class, the courses move through material quickly. you will be challenged. i pulled many all-nighters, but that was because of procrastination mostly.  most of the classes are curved to a b- and sometimes scoring a 40 will be an a.  it does suck busting your ass and getting a score like that compared to the easy high school courses and getting 100 without even studying. you learn to live with it. seeing my first ever b was a big deal for me. i didn't care as much when i got my first c.

the cool stuff comes in the upperclassmen courses. most of your first and second year will be theory and all the crap you need to understand to actually apply it correctly. i was a mech.e and one of the courses i loved the most was building a battle bot junior year when teamed with eces. 

it does kick your ass, but if you make it through it you are prepared for anything at any job you will encounter afterwards. even when you get a 50 on a test, it's not the end of the world. just figure out where you went wrong and try to fix it for next time. don't forget the end goal is to get a job, not just a letter on a piece of paper. the Cornell University reputation is very good in the work field and many times you will get an interview just by having Cornell University on you resume. 

i started out freshman year going hardcore into studying. then i eased up a little bit and got the full college experience while still passing all my classes. if you plan accordingly, you can easily go out once or twice a week. by my senior year, everyday was fair game and i would have weeks going out 6 nights and still getting everything done i needed to.

edit: one more thing. fuck yeah it's worth it. i graduated 2009 and got the m.eng in 2010. currently working for a big name tech. company in silicon valley and if you factor in some extra benefits, i'll be clearing six figures this year working around 35 hours a week. ",Comment,Neutral

Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/sf80z/how_hard_is_Cornell University_engineering/,"everyone's different. i graduated a few years ago with a cs degree, and i had time to minor in meche, joined a fraternity, and was very social and did a ton of stuff outside my major. maybe i'm just naturally better at it, but the real lesson is time management. there were definitely times where i had to sacrifice my social life for getting a big project done, but the opposite was also true. on the other hand i knew people that partied even more than i did, and people that almost never left their dorm rooms. whatever kind of life you want to have, if you put your mind to it, you can do it. there will be stressful times, but for me it was finding a good balance.

the first semester will be a good time to get yourself acquainted with the engineering school. you won't be taking any major specific classes, so you'll have a chance to get used to seeing how much you can handle. if you like studying in groups, you can also use this time to find other people to study with. if you're struggling after a month or two, talk to your advisor and see what you can do about making your schedule more manageable.

as for pursuing your interests, make sure to look for clubs and friends that have the same interests as you. while i was there i worked on cuair (a project team that builds uav's), and it was a lot of fun. if you feel like you have your classes under control after the first semester or so, any of the project teams are a great way to expand your learning while also applying the stuff you learn in the classroom in a real way. as a cs major, a lot of the real applicable stuff i learned was not in the class, but programming for cuair , doing my co-op, and taking the game design courses (tons of fun). that said, those things are extra time, and are a lot harder, but for me it wasn't something i worried about since it was fun and something i found myself wanting to go to the computer lab to get done.

as for the grades, don't worry about them too much. i got a few c+'s and b-'s. i also got a bunch of a range grades. the grades matter a little bit, depending on what you want to do right out of college. it's worth working hard to keep them up, but unless you want to work on wall street, as long as you have a b+ average or better your gpa is less relevant than your experiences and skills. take that with a grain of salt, since that's just my own personal experience.

as for the whole 50s on tests business, you only seem to be listening to a small subset of engineers. yes, the tests are hard, and yes, the curve is hard, but i've found if you do an honest night's work every night, you come out on top. the fact is, Cornell University or not, you have to work your ass off to be good at engineering, physics, or whatever you wind up doing. nothing is easy. nothing is even close. 

that said, going out one night a week and still keeping up your grades is possible, especially as a freshman. my advice: do you like cold weather (i do)? go for Cornell University. do you want to work hard and get good at engineering? i don't know where else you got accepted to, but you definitely can at Cornell University.

i know taking the plunge and sending in the damn deposit can be tough, but fear not. you'll have to work hard eventually if you want to get good. good luck, hope i helped.

Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/sf80z/how_hard_is_Cornell University_engineering/,"hm, this is a strong sentiment for me, strong enough for me to break my reddit lurker status just to comment on this. edit: i apologize for the wall of text; i didn't realize that what i typed was quite this long...

i'm a freshman who is essentially going to be a junior in orie next year. i entered orie, toyed with the idea of switching to cs, then went back to orie. i came in with credit for chem, phys b and bc (among other insignificant credit *coughstatsbiocough*).

let me briefly tell you my sentiments as a kind of disclaimer: i love Cornell University, but i'm very unhappy in engineering and with the general engineering program as a whole. at this point, i'm willing to throw my advanced standing away and switch majors. i am considering switching into applied economics and management, the business school here at Cornell University, while pursuing a minor in operations research and management science (the only part of engineering that i'm actually interested in). i would never, however, consider switching universities, nor have i actually chosen to depart from engineering quite yet.

my advice for you, don't be disheartened that you don't have bc credit; 1910 will whip you into shape for math, and you'll end up more prepared than your average freshman entering with bc credit. having been through 1920 in my first semester, i can say that i definitely was not prepared for the rigor that Cornell University expects of their engineers; not just with bc. 1910 and 1920 have lousier curves, but most courses (if my research serves me correctly) curve in the b range, depending on the class. others that lack curves may have substantial opportunities for you to succeed (for example, this semester of 1920 allegedly has no curve, but you are allowed to correct your tests for 1/2 credit back).

test-wise, be prepared to do significantly worse than you did in hs. i was a straight-a student in a highly competitive top public high school. here, i'm good enough to be dean's list-ed in engineering. you've got to get used to getting a paper back that has a grade in the 60s or 70s, even if you worked and studied like crazy. it's depressing, but you've just got to keep a sense of self-confidence. often times, you'll get your exam back, and with such a grade, still be on or near the mean. as long as you do your work and attend lectures, you'll be ahead of a lot of people. remember, everyone else is in the same boat, and many can't be bothered to actually try.

probably the second-greatest merit of Cornell University engineering (besides the career placement), however, is entirely non-academic. your advisors don't really know much about the first two years: they will be able to help you if you choose to enter their department, and try to sell you their major otherwise. engineering advising is horrifically bad and have given me poor advice on several occasions. you'll learn more about yourself, by yourself, than you could ever imagine. you'll learn how you work, how you socialize, how you manage time, how you can live, how you best succeed, and what you can and can't do for a living. i can easily say that i've learned more about myself in the past year than i had all throughout hs. as for class issues, you'll learn the workings of the engineering program through your upperclassman peers (hint: join clubs!), what courses to take, and how best to take them. 

use your freshman year, meet and connect with others both in your major and out. work closely with them; they will be your support network through the good and bad. i have time to socialize on the weekends; the fraternity life doesn't appeal to me, but i would surely have enough time to do it. i am heavily involved in a couple of organizations on campus, and definitely have time left in my day. the severity of the workload isn't bad at all, provided that you stick to somewhere between 15 and 18 credits. just know that not all credits are created equal, and there are classes that have ""reputations"" for being not worth their credits relative to time invested.

last but certainly not least: in engineering (both here and anywhere), the first two years are the hardest. if you can make it out with your interest, confidence and gpa intact, you're set for the remainder of your time here. the program is designed to naturally push you to a field of study that you're a good fit for. if you know you're not liking something, reassess yourself. i personally don't like the engineering prerequisites and distribution requirements that are required; i have a legitimate interest in orie, but it is very difficult to find application to my intended field of financial analysis and management in most parts of the engineering distribution.

as some parting words: you've gotten into what is arguably the hardest school in Cornell University to get into. worse comes to worst, it's extremely easy to transfer to anywhere else within Cornell University, and Cornell University has a lot of majors on offer as compared with other schools out there.

p.s. just as a shade of advice, cs majors have people throwing jobs at them right now. at the rate that it's going, the cs job market might become oversaturated in the near future. i would suggest that you go first with the added specialization in ece (which will teach you some coding courtesy of the recommended cs2110 course), then do a minor or something in cs. what's more key (as far as i've gathered from career fairs) is that you know how to program; i'd suggest that you don't dedicate all your study to the art of programming. that's just my analysis, not sure how correct it is or will be.",Comment,Neutral
Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/sf80z/how_hard_is_Cornell University_engineering/,"as a double major between engineering and arts, certainly it can be hard a lot of the time, but that's how you know you're learning a lot. i think not enough people come here with the mindset that the primary goal in college is to challenge yourself to the greatest extent that you can. one thing that you'll notice after a semester or two is that Cornell University is really great at ramping up your ability to balance the extremes in terms of work and having fun. i've thus far managed to take a very difficult schedule each semester and maintain a pretty decent gpa while joining a fraternity and (frequently) going out 2-3 times per week. it's definitely possible, particularly once you adapt to the mindset of college. i'm probably going to spend the whole night working on algorithms tonight with a few other people, and i'm fine with that. it feels like i'm accomplishing something.

in terms of job placement, intellectual stimulation, and challenge, it's all extremely rewarding.

edit: oh yeah also, one thing i've found is (particularly in cs here) your fellow students are incredibly stimulating and motivated. hell i know people who owned successful web design companies in high school, people who have created published xbox games, truly passionate and motivated people. go find them and make friends, they'll change your life.",Comment,Positive

also, if i were you, i'd go with cs, make websites, do side projects.

Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/sf80z/how_hard_is_Cornell University_engineering/,"well i'm not gonna go into the amount of detail as other people have, but here's my two cents. i came into Cornell University in the engineering school thinking about ece/cs same as you. i started off with ece and decided to switch last semester to cs with a minor in ece.

if you're gonna stick with one of those majors, there will be some weeks where its all but impossible to go out. when a programming pset due date is coming up you'll have to be prepared to spend a lot of hours working, unless you're really on top of your game and get stuff done in a timely manner. in my experience that never works out.

i don't really go to that many parties, but that's by choice. if i wanted to, or if a bunch of my friends were also going then i can almost always make time. like other people have said, meet people in your classes!!! it becomes so much easier to run through a problem set when you have 5 of you working together on the tougher problems. also take advantage of office hours!

after the first test or two you take here, you'll get used to low means. but a mean in the 60s also means that an a is in the 70-80 range :)",Comment,Neutral
Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/sf80z/how_hard_is_Cornell University_engineering/,"take initiative to talk to your professors/tas, in case you need guidance on which classes to take and whatnot, they're more personable than you think.  one simple question to any prof/ta along the lines of the curriculum will be answered in the most non-bullshit way.

if you find your advisor to be of no help, switch advisors immediately (simply state reasons such as incompatibility issues, his office is closer, i've been talking to him, or w.e).  will help you down the line.  my friend had an advisor who basically told her - without fuss - ""prof a sucks, do not take this in the fall, take it in the spring, prof b is much easier."", ""prof c is a genius, she is doing research, ask her for opportunities, prof d doesn't have the funds.""  when i asked my advisor what classes i should be taking, he basically replied along the lines of, ""well, everybody's different, different styles of learning, and pace, you gotta know what's right for you,"" and proceeded to whip out the engineering handbook, flip to page 17, and looked at the chart together with me for 15 minutes.  after my third visit, he finally told me i actually had to fulfill liberal arts classes, and should be taking at least 1 per semester (i could've found this out myself had i read the fine print on handbook).  not to say he was a bad person, dude was a genius, no doubt very accomplished, definitely wanna be kept as a ""friend-professor"" down the line, but not as an advisor.  don't be afraid to talk to other advisors for advice, even if you're not their ""student"".  walk in, just say that your own advisor is away from office today, i can't find him, and you need info quick, let's talk.

learn to deal with administration.  if you have a silver tongue and can get anyone to do your bidding, then disregard this. might not be good advice, but presuming every engineer to be socially awkward this is something to learn.  especially with bursar office/financial aid ladies, every answer they give will most likely contain bullshit tailored to fit to every student and no great advice pertaining to your situation is given unless you keep prying.  same goes for any other administration i've dealt with.  don't get me wrong, they're nice, extremely nice, but it almost seems that they are trained to turn you away in the nicest, no-complaint way possible.

if you are on your shit, well-informed, you're good to go.  read the handbooks, read the planners, read the whole Cornell University website regarding policies, whether or not you think you'll need em.  you will.

ap classes doesn't matter.  retake, or not retake it, it's two sides of the same coin in the long run.  retaking means you will brush up and learn stuff, and prolly get an a in engineering, looking real good (okay, i'll be realistic, b-, but you get my point).  not retaking means being ahead of the game timewise, but will tackle to learn something fresh and new first semester.

and as always, have fun and best of luck. :)",Comment,Neutral

Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/8dadwc/this_has_to_be_the_most_depressing_school_ive/,"i would say first off it s dependent on what other schools you got into and we could address some of the pro/cons of each because well if standford is a option with their weather and academics it s a no brained. but for each question i ll give my honest opinion. 

1.) yes the weather is definitely not the best here and there is a distinct grey that hangs over ithaca from around november to early april with a couple beautiful days in between. however you do benefit from two things: 1.) snow if you like it, we have a ski mountain 30 mins away and ithaca looks and feels very calm and serene when it snows. 2.) seasons, having lived in new england my entire life i love having seasons it makes you love summer more, allows for beautiful trees in the fall especially at Cornell University, and allows for a wide variety of activities. 

2.) ithaca is commonly know here as  centrally isolated  meaning there s almost anything you could ever need in some form but it s not very close to a major city unless you count syracuse. sure there isn t super upscale dining or the nightlife of a major city but both those are here in some sense. bars, apartments, and frat houses are all very popular for night life and ithaca has some good restaurants. additionally there s any sort of store you could really ever need, but as you said especially in commons it has a distinctly older vibe but i wouldn t say much in ithaca is run down at all. almost all of the shopping/stores are brand new due to recent growth. 

3.)  i would say on average Cornell University probably does have a more solemn student body which i personally think comes from two major things: 1.) its been a long winter and people are looking forward to summer and 2.) more of the cause lies in that Cornell University is a challenging place to be as a student professors truly push you to work hard(much harder than comparable schools). 

4.) Cornell University is jabbed as being the bottom ivy which has some merit for sure but at the end of the day i would argue it s not perceived that differently than brown or dartmouth and certainly ahead of some peer institutions depending on the subject and your definition of  peer institutions . lastly on this point no matter how you slice it going to Cornell University you re going to one of the 20 best universities/colleges in the us.

i work as a graduate resident fellow on west campus (see [https://westcampushousesystem.Cornell University.edu/grf-job-description](https://westcampushousesystem.Cornell University.edu/grf-job-description)) , so i'm not paying any rent. additionally, my meals are covered for most of the school year other than winter and summer.  i previously lived near the ithaca downtown commons and i was paying about $1200 (with utilities) for a 1 bedroom apartment. 

most of the people in my cohort and in my program are paying a lot less ($750 range); they generally don't live where the undergrads are.

**what do you do for fun? do you ever make the trek to nyc or boston?**

i go to concerts for fun and make the trip to nyc once every three weeks or so. one thing to keep in mind as a phd student is that you really want to find a place where you can buckle down and focus on your studies. nyc is close enough where it's an easy trip (ourbus is very reliable), but far enough where it's not sustainable every weekend.

**what s the overall quality of life in ithaca?**

i think ithaca is great for phd students and it also seems like it's a nice place for my mentees. the university will try to sell you on the food (""there are more restaurants per capita than new york city!), but the best restaurants in ithaca can't compare to a major city.

**what problems do you have with living in ithaca and, inversely to that, what s your favorite part?**

i would say that the local healthcare specialists (e.g., dentists, allergists, etc.) have a stranglehold on the market. they're not great, but Cornell University health (in my experience) has a lot of competent and great providers who you can see.

i love Cornell University and really like the students here. the students here are really impressive and passionate about the things they're involved in. additionally, Cornell University offers *a lot* of support for undergraduate students who want to get involved in research (e.g., einhorn grant, cals grants), so your mentees can easily get funding for honors thesis projects, etc.

**do you have any advice?**

when making your decision, you should really think about the lab culture that you'll be part of and what you want to do after you earn your phd. what type of students have your potential advisor(s) graduated? are they in academia? industry? where do you want to be? additionally, sometimes your advisor doesn't work out. are there other people who can serve as a mentor that you would be excited to work with?

Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/zwin9n/graduate_studentswhats_your_most_and_least/,"here s my somewhat different opinion from a recently graduated ph.d. there is an opportunity cost for being in the middle of nowhere. you re not going to network as much as in a big city or a tech hub. you re not going to have as many in person seminars from professors from other universities. if you re dating the pool is very liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed. if you d rather hang out with people who are not students your options are liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed compared to a big city. got some esoteric hobby that requires a club/group? you may have trouble maintaining it in ithaca. 

ithaca is beautiful and when you re an undergrad the opportunity cost problem is negated because you re surrounded by a lot of other undergrads and being put into situations that encourage interaction such as coursework and group projects. when you re a grad student you have to create these situations after the first year or so and it is difficult. networking is also not as crucial for undergrads when all you need to do is land a job out of college vs a tenure track position or a more skilled industry position. i d say if you have the option to go for an equally prestigious university in a large city that would be preferable, generally speaking.

ithaca itself has lots to offer so long as you don't expect it to be a major city. there's lots of food options in and around the area, and plenty of outdoorsy stuff to explore. rent can vary, but it'll almost certainly be much less than nyc or boston. obligatory advice to avoid ithaca renting properties.

i really loved my time in ithaca - it's missing some of the more specific things you'd find in a major city (for me, it was a fencing club), but there's a somewhat functional public transit system in the tcat and plenty to get out and do if you look for it.

any advice i can give would be to search for what speaks most to you in the program and area, and a visit beforehand is probably the best way to do it if you can manage.

>what do you do for fun? do you ever make the trek to nyc or boston?
do you have any advice?

when i decided to make the move from big metropolitan cities to Cornell University, it was to embrace the totally different sort of setting. i think that sort of mindset would benefit anyone who's making such a move.

sure, it's a much quieter setting, but man is it a gorgeous setting. i've been to 50+ countries and all 7 continents and there still isn't a more beautiful campus than Cornell University imo. place looks like rivendell for half the year (and narnia for the other half...) 

in that vein, there's a ton to do that you couldn't easily do if you were in a huge city. go trekking in the gorges and end up at some breathtaking waterfalls at the end, drive out 10 mins on a whim with your friends and have an impromptu stargazing night because there's so little light pollution and you can just enjoy the milky way with your naked eye, go to the apple orchards, just enjoy a jazz concert on campus because bands do actually head over (trick is getting tickets before they sell out), etc.

but if physical beauty of a campus doesn't mean much to you and your social/entertainment schedule depends on when your next trip to manhattan is, then you're probably better off at Massachusetts Institute of Technology/ Princeton University . hope that helps and good luck wherever you end up!",Comment,Positive

the cost of living in ithaca is much lower in general than in cambridge, though ithaca rents are artificially high due to a smaller market and a very low vacancy rate. newer housing tends to be quite pricey, though some of what's being built is in the ""affordable housing"" category. the newest apartment complexes close to campus are especially expensive, though each new building leaves some of the older, or not-as-close, properties in a position to be a better value. rents tend not to go down, but they don't climb as fast in the older properties.

someone mentioned the maplewood apartments, which is marketed to grad students, and is just a few years old. developed by a commercial developer on Cornell University land. very convenient to campus and fairly reasonably priced for the quality. the hasbrouck apartments are owned by Cornell University, on the far edge of north campus, and as someone else mentioned, are really geared toward grad students with families, or at least partners.

my cousin who's at that other school in cambridge is considering a postdoc at Cornell University, and the rents here look reasonable by comparison.

the idea of being a grf, or grad resident fellow, for one of the west campus house system communities, is a great one, assuming you like the idea of living around, and interacting a lot with, undergrads.

you mention that you're coming from a big school in an urban center, so it's worth knowing that ithaca is not a big city. it has a great variety of food and music and art and theatre and other cultural advantages beyond what's typical for a city this size, and i write about a lot of it for 14850 magazine, but if you're used to 24/7 shops and eateries on every corner, or clubs open until 4am, you'll see the difference fast. cambridge and boston would offer that urban feel, and even though Princeton University  is smaller and quieter than ithaca, it's close enough to manhattan and philadelphia for easier day trips or weekend getaways. we're 4 or 5 hours from nyc, philly, toronto, montreal, boston; 3 from albany and buffalo.

if you do not have this data you *could* hand-wave allude to it by looking at post-grad performance of the major as this data gets [published](https://www.cs.Cornell University.edu/undergrad/cscareers/placementreport) to the public. Cornell University cs grads still get good jobs and get into good grad programs at the usual rates. i find it very unlikely there is some sudden new issue of poorly-abled cs students. cs has been 'hot' for like a decade now.

anyways:

>while this is expected and completely normal what s not normal is that an alarming number of people are simply not aware of the basics of coding.

it is essentially impossible to entirely cheat through the entire cs major. exams carry a significant enough portion of the grade for most courses and projects aren't exactly super leniently graded.

most of the 4000+ level courses are pretty hard, and frankly, Cornell University does not really give students a lot of time to, 'get good' at programming. besides 2300 and 3300 if they're still the same, and that 5000 level 'software engineering' class, many of the projects/assignments are basically some shell to fill-in where the relevant theory being learned at the time needs to go. as such you end up with lots of people who have lots of cs theory (or maybe a c/c- understanding) without a ton of practical programming experience. projects and self-learning exist to fill this gap, but the semester is busy enough that i don't blame students who aren't grinding out full-stack web apps or knowing the best way to do oop, etc. additionally, like /u/public_menace_2702 mentions, a ton of the cs projects have a needless layer of ambiguity and obtuseness because our program is supposed to be hard (or something).

>an alarming number of people who attend my office hours straight up just expect me to give them the code which in my opinion is very concerning. a couple of days ago, a girl during my office hours demanded answers from me since the assignment was due that night.

>i also do believe that there has to be some kind of restriction. due to the large influx, a lot of tas including myself feel overwhelmed and there are just way too many people trying to get their code fixed during office hours, which is not how it is supposed to be.

[people going to office hours are more than likely going to be stuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selection_bias). students with a good grasp of the concepts, or maybe with a good grasp of concept but poor programming habits, probably aren't going to camp your office hours or show up last minute the day an assignment is due. this does not give you a good sampling for the overall quality of the cs population.

a second point you somewhat make is office hours availability. Cornell University has been trash at good office hours staffing for years. the issue is not a sudden influx of cheater-kids-who-cant-program, rather, that Cornell University has allowed an expansion of the cs program without proper addition of staffing resources.

imo this whole post just seems like a shitty gatekeep of how cs should be more exclusive and that lots of kids don't deserve to be in it. newsflash: a lot of the kids who started off as cs are also just in it for the money -- if a student was accepted to Cornell University they 99% are able to graduate from the program given fair resourcing and work ethic",Comment,Neutral
Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/zcny2o/opinion_cs_major_has_way_too_many_people_and_it/,"correct me if im wrong, but isn't people not understanding the fundamentals of cs a reflection of the 1000's level classes rather than the students? i feel like it's wrong to ""weed out"" some academic fields, and it feels very elitist especially because a lot of people come to college wanting to explore & learn subjects they may not have access to previously (for ex, i come from a low income school and we had very very very little resources to learn about cs and i think one school provided cs class). everyone who i know that does cs works so incredibly hard regardless of what background they came with. the way i see it, they're working as hard as they can, making use of the resources they have, whileee balancing a multitude of other things inherent to attending an academically challenging university. if there is a really deep misunderstanding in cs fundamentals, i feel like there should be a comprehensive revision of the cs curricula rather than ""weeding people out"" and only allowing students who had the privilege and ability to explore cs before or during their earlier years at college to be able to learn. like ppl who have never done cs before are no less capable of learning and being successful.",Comment,Neutral

i do not care what bs the admins hide behind but people need to be called out and named. drag these rapists, their enablers and apologists into the light. show them they can no longer hide behind their frat brothers. show them that they can't hide behind their trust funds. show them that they can't hide behind their ""ignorance."" and especially show how little if any support the college is providing. 

as the saying goes, squeeky wheel gets the grease. raise enough of a stink the college will have to address it.",Comment,Neutral
Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/mp4b1c/sick_of_sexual_assault_at_this_school_tw/,"well, ill attempt to take a whack at alot of this at the risk of getting downvoted into hidden text.

1. response to these sorts of things is a deeply complicated issue. while i am not 100% sure how effective staffers are at addressing these issues vs the average or the ideal, what i can say is that there are many many things that lead to a perceived lack of action. for the most part, for two individuals where one might assert that another comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted some act of sexual violence, evidencing that sexual violence is a pipe dream. principally because we operate under the idea that one is innocent until proven guilty, 'he said she said' issues result in a stalemate that cannot be reliably resolved. this is not to say that every attempt at reporting an issue is folly, but rather that if you attend a party, interact with a person consensually, your friends perceive you to be having a good time, are rather inebriated, go up to that individuals room and have sex behind a closed door, the details can get muddied. the condom being taken off (issue 9 you have) would be one heavily complicated issue because there is no way to prove that and the assailant can say ""idk wtf she's talking about"" and the problem stops there. many issue that people will claim sexual assault on will tend to be under those circumstances. moreover, there is probably a real lack of community surrounding those circumstances where many people have not themselves taken action to paint a more favorable picture for the victim. bottom line, there's a lot to discuss before claiming the title-9 people aren't doing their jobs properly. perhaps i identify with that a bit more having been directly involved in sexual assault and prevention in the military though.

2. probably true, i'll bet at some rate if you've made it through to your early 20s as a girl then you've probably experienced something that would qualify as ""disgusting"". with that said, i am not sure how particular that is to Cornell University vs everywhere else... that is probably a topic that demands some measure of action, but in how far it is actionable and what negative consequences result are also up for discussion. 

3. i didn't attend this play because i'm a transfer student, but i do have a comment on perceived ability to detect x. one thing i've learned in life (pretty recently after coming here actually) is that our intelligence might not be measured by our capacity to perform some task or comprehend a particular idea, but rather our capacity for a lack of thought (inversely related to our intelligence). this capacity for a lack of thought can plague even the brightest of student where they simply neglected to think about a particular detail or idea. think of it as a sort of lower operating bound for peoples general thinking. now this probably ties into your idea where the consent education being performed is not sufficient, but i don't think that starts here but rather at high school and beyond... and frankly in the home. sadly, that's a lot harder to regulate and push to a happy medium compared to controlling our community. 

4. don't have too much stake in this issue, but i can venture as to why they might have that question in an application process. hell, it is a simple question like ""why is medicine important"" or ""what is good about maintaining a standard of care"" that might appear on a questionnaire for a prospective medical student. these questions force people to dig deep and really touch on core issues and ideas of a particular subject. i don't think ""why is consent important"" is insensitive or a stupid question to ask of somebody, and i can decently measure their insight to such an issue by their response. i also don't think one merits being on an e-board or some comMassachusetts Institute of Technologytee just because they have been involved in what the board surveys... ideally the ""right"" candidate is selected. its difficult to really respond to this complaint as it feels a bit more emotionally and anecdotally driven vs something logical with a point to address. that said, i agree that men do comMassachusetts Institute of Technology the majority of violent sexual crime.. although i'm not super sure that is a particularly insightful thing to add at the end. we also make up the vast majority of prison populations and other crimes... but its generally understood why that is. 

5. this point is probably the biggest mistake you've made in your post. i'm not sure if your goal is to muster up all of the female redditors and engage in solidarity... but if you're trying to reach either men who are complicit, or men who are or might be engaging in these actions that you abhor, your language here is pretty unproductive. there is no objective reality that ""men are trash"" and suggesting that i might just be trash because i don't identify with the sentiment that 50% of the population is trash.... well that's laughable. boxing a group in for what the minority is responsible for seems counter to what i anticipate your stances towards other issues are, and in general is bad practice. furthermore, suggesting that i might befriend rapists is completely unfounded. i cant say that i know any myself, but being the guy who is launching a pseudo-campaign against the one guy out of 30 of us that is pretty sexually aggressive/inappropriate, i can say that i'm unlikely to fall into befriending a ""rapist"". moreover, i can safely presume that many of my male counterparts agree with this sentiment. if you want to touch the group responsible for these issues, demonizing them will lead you to spinning your tires real quick.

6. i can see why this is a barrier. had a thought earlier revolving an inability to integrate strong consent training into the school because of how rigorous other classes are. possibly resolved by just making it a mandatory class that is moderately difficult and is required for graduation like a fws.

7. this will touch on the same issue of you boxing in a group because of a minority. there is a lot that goes into investigating people regarding title-9 at the school level... it is even more complicated at the social/fraternity level because there are many less resources involved in proving the issue. aside from the reality that some fraternities are very big and do not reflect the actions of one member, removing one from the collective (which i believe would be your desired outcome of accused sexual assault) is not really feasible. bylaws and alumni aside, these guys are more bound to trust each other and are pretty well integrated in their own communities. with the amount of potential for miscommunication, other drama, and fighting that would result for such a move, its very difficult to believe or hope that a move to punish a member for what they were accused of, by a potentially spiteful significant other said, would get passed. frankly there is more to this topic... but the stereotype with goldman sachs and ""daddy"" comment sort of indicates to me that you're just anti frat... that and your comment 12, which i will get to. so there's no need to go further.

8. yeah don't do that... pretty obvious point here.

9. pretty sure this point is a pipe dream, but i'm also not sure this call for becoming familiar with psychology is really well founded. you don't suddenly become socially well acclimated or sensitive to a particular issue because you understand ""basic psychology"". additionally these thing in basic psychology revolve around gradients in the collective... they aren't the end all be all for individuals. but, as far as the response to immediately report it... that's kind of a reality. the more prompt the response is, the better for both the victim and future potential victims. understanding they may feel shame, that doesn't not remove the raw reality of what is or isn't. people aren't to blame for not reporting somebody in a timely manner, but actions (in this case inactions) do have consequences. its especially easy for somebody who isn't touched by this issue to ask the question because it is a sort of ""logical"" approach. for as black and white as you see things here, a lot of what you're saying is a little counter intuitive and neglects considering alternative perspectives

10. roping your second point in 9. to this issue. overly-sexually active women are not holistically the result of trauma... not sure how you could claim this is unilaterally true. additionally, it shouldn't be a novel idea to understand that many guys looking for longevity in a relationship aren't interested in somebody who has slept around a lot. you have no right to blame people for their preference either. again, most guys don't shame girls for being ""sluts"" or call them whores amongst themselves... they're not all barbarians. preference is preference.  also endeavoring to bring that particular issue and tie it into relationships with rapists is shameful. these two issues are completely unrelated and endeavoring to relate them is more of a testament to your generally negative disposition towards (allow me to be presumptuous, but your language sort of affords it) men. 

11. cannot comment here, never been to a gyno appointment for which i was the patient. that said, you cant make an assertion like this without substance and hope to be taken seriously. perhaps by peers who are aligned with your ideas, but not by anybody else who would be able to aid in taking action. what you consider inappropriate might very well be the case, but when you don't give me an account of a particular event and at the same time say things like ""if you think ""all men are trash"" posts are wrong, then you're probably trash"" or ""literally every frat has at least one rapist""... well i cant trust your ability to be objective. despite that, if things are fucky over at Cornell University health, then that is bad.",Comment,Neutral

Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/sqfmj8/can_we_talk_about_how_elitist_and_privileged_so/,"i agree with this- Cornell University is institutionally quite hostile to those that don t come from wealthy means. 

i can t fathom being able to afford the full price of tuition here. i was lucky to get a great financial aid package upon admission, which gave me a false sense that Cornell University would be very accommodating. 

the fact that financial aid was distributed so late is quite honestly unforgivable and completely soured my perception of the university as an institution. my family went through drastic employment changes last year that shifted income considerably. with the opaque method of calculating financial need, i was unsure of how my family would be affected for way longer than necessary. 

also, things on campus are just so expensive in general. from meal plans, to pe classes, to gym fees. it s insane. sometimes i just sit back in awe as people pay for these things without any hesitation or concern. when i was forced to have a meal plan for on campus living, i rationed our swipes and brbs strategically since the thought of wasting a 15 dollar meal i paid for because it expired after a week stressed me out so much. 

in general, i find that people here are very unaware of how the majority of people in us from non-wealthy backgrounds live day-to-day, and how stressful it can be as one of those students. end of my mini rant lol",Comment,Neutral
Cornell University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell University/comments/sqfmj8/can_we_talk_about_how_elitist_and_privileged_so/,"very poor student from the northeast (<30k a year for a household of 5 in a major city type poor) and 10/10 agree. my experience at Cornell University made me painfully aware that i wasn't socialized for this type of environment at all.

it feels like there are performative activists everywhere at this school, and it's exhausting to continuously hear our experiences be reduced to talking points for class debates and group assignments because there isn't a space to disengage for an extended period of time. especially when the talking points are blatantly wrong or overlook the nuances and facets of these experiences.

i honestly don't have a good time interacting with most other students either because our experiences are so different: it is hard to have engaging conversations when you're consistently being probed and prodded about my existence. and i don't know... i also feel like there's a gap in maturity between students who aren't privileged and students who are because we've had to be more vigilant growing up and take on greater burden/responsibilities that have more significant consequences which makes maintaining relationships very difficult. obviously, like you said, this isn't anyone's fault. but i don't think people are aware of how inconsiderate or selfish certain things can be.

your comment on clubs is very relatable as well and isn't talked about enough imo. the clubs that i joined here aren't inviting at all: it feels like being part of a business, even some of the social ones. there is a major lack the community in these spaces (which i brought up to these e-boards before; they looked bewildered about the idea of fostering community!), and consistent pressure on members to produce content often on tight turnaround times. i ended up quiting all of the clubs i was involved in the start of my 3rd year because they made me feel drained and unhappy which sucked because i really enjoy these areas.

late financial aid at this point is a genuine attempt to trap low-income students into taking out loans and there's no way around this.

overall, i'm sorry that this has been your experience at Cornell University. i surround myself with a lot of people who aren't as privileged as the average student, and these are very common criticisms if it helps. i also appreciate this post because i think this is a pretty big issue but gets overlooked because we don't matter to other students or the school.",Comment,Neutral

the veterns community is well organized and sort of like a family-at least on the undergrad side. they have their own program house. they frequently are invited to participate in events in the local area or hold events of their own. they get top pick for class enrollment and housing, while also receiving receiving yellow ribbon so the gi bill is left over for grad school. they have a group chat and socialize frequently.",Comment,Neutral

the Cornell University health insurance is one of the better ones for student mental health -- it covers private therapists who aren't associated with the university and my co-pays are only $10. but there are normally only openings between terms. we get paid a decent amount when you look at our housing costs compared to other universities (though ithaca housing is quite $$ for the town's size).

if you can talk to people in your potential department, they'll tell you more specifically if the department does a good job supporting its students or not. the grad school itself is generally not great, but that will usually only matter if your department is failing you. also important: ask if your potential grad program has cohensiveness and support amongst the grad students (are there ways to socialize easily? do they have events?) because if not, you'll need to put upfront effort into finding a community of people to befriend, which can be difficult with anxiety.",Comment,Neutral

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ro22g/compsci_majors/,"cs major here. most of this thread is accurate.

far more people get in via upper division admission than anything else, so don't let the fact that you weren't direct adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted discourage you. direct adMassachusetts Institute of Technology is only given to a handful of students, and upper div adMassachusetts Institute of Technology isn't going to put you behind.

that said, the program is very competitive. they are down to a little over 20% adMassachusetts Institute of Technology rate. so understand that if you want to be in this major you will have to drop a 3.8+ in the intro cs classes (142, and 143). and at least a 3.4 in your other course work (calculus classes, science classes, etc.) though a 3.6+ would be better.

is this impossible? no. i did it, and all my friends in the cs department did it. that said, it is very hard. don't think that getting 4.0s through out high school will prepare you for it. and compared to gateway courses ap doesn't count for shit. you will have to work for this.

worth it? hell yes. i am given interesting problems every day, and there are amazing opportunities that have opened up to me. i'm working insanely hard, and loving every minute of it. right now i am sitting in a beautiful hotel room, paid for by a company that wants to interview me tomorrow, you will get to do things that other majors dream of, and will be paid well for it. but you will work for it. this major demands you love what you do, it is impossible to put in the hours otherwise.

if you want to do this, and are willing to work hard, go for it. there is practically no where in the world better to be. but if you have this vague notion of ""maybe this cs thing could be cool, like, i could, you know, make games n'shit"" and want to get stoned off you ass all day every day, then don't bother writing the application essays.",Comment,Neutral

i would argue that it's much harder to get in via direct admission than upper division.  the direct adMassachusetts Institute of Technology program exists to pull students away from schools like Massachusetts Institute of Technology, so you have to have ridiculously good grades coming from high school.

i got in under accelerated admission, but the most common way in by far is upper division.  don't be discouraged by the competitiveness.  i find that people who are aware, and freaked out by the competitiveness tend to be the people who get in.  the ones who act like the grades aren't important and don't put in their 100% are the ones who tend to get rejected.

also, as a general point of advice if you end up here, don't listen to people who have been rejected.  they'll tell you that you need perfect stats and it's almost impossible to get in.  more often than not, they're making out out to be way more competitive than it is (to make them feel better about themselves maybe?).

but besides that, i don't think you could choose a better major or school to go to.  cs is such a valuable degree right now and that is only going to be increasing, and seattle is a great place to be as well in our industry for obvious reasons.  the department here is excellent, we are well taken care of, highly recruited, there are lots of research opportunities, and the faculty is phenomenal. 

it is well worth it to absolutely bust your ass in the intro courses and get in.  as a side note though, there are two other great majors here, acms, and infomatics, that offer a blend of cse curriculum as well.  these are valuable majors as well and offer a good alternative if cse doesn't work out.  one of my good friends is an info major and he is just as talented a programmer as alot of people in the cs department.

1. helen posted a message from the cse chairman hank levy (i think) saying that he acknowledges that getting into cse is tough and people getting adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted is way to small compared to the people applying. he said that they intended to increase the size of the department (and has done so in 2001(or around that time)) but because of the budget cuts in 2008(if i remember correctly) they were unable to grow the department. he said that all interested should still try applying and something something else, i think that's the whole message anyway.
2. marty posted that everybody should try because as his father (i think) said that if you don't even try then you have don't even have any chance (or something).

anyway that's what was posted. i really think that they want to adMassachusetts Institute of Technology as many interested student as possible but because of their budget they can't so that's why it's so competitive getting into the department.

what i would suggest is as quickly as possible get into cse 142 and 143  and other cs/e prereq that you know you can get a good grade at and work your ass on those classes, get 4.0s, forget your social life for those 2 quarter until you get through accelerated admissions, while keeping in mind that this is the sacrifice you have to make to get in.

**as for getting in:** it's hard either way.  are you more for engineering and hard sciences or languages and softer sciences?  for me, personally, i was trying to be a mechanical engineer and got pulled into cse, so i'd already taken all of the prereq's for both departments.  play to your strengths (ap credits) and future goals.  come up with a backup plan on the chance you don't get in.  taking prereq's for another department is how i found cse, maybe you'll find your intrest is elsewhere too.  there is a lot to be said for a generalist who is trying to specialize in one area.  use your range of experiences on your application essay.

the different schools (school of arts & sciences vs school of engineering) have different counselors.  they know all about this.  once you're in, talk to your cse counselors (but don't waste their precious time), they're amazing and can help a lot.

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ro22g/compsci_majors/,"i have to voice my opinion, even though i'm staring at a million downvotes. octember, i'm 75% certain you won't get into cse (those are the odds, the cse department usually adMassachusetts Institute of Technologys less than 25% of applicants). it is **amazingly** hard to get adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted. your ap credits will not be looked at, you'll realize when you get to college that ap classes are much easier, and that no one really considers them past the college admission board. i have applied to cse 3 times, including through accelerated admission, and have been denied all three times. i advise you to look into other schools, rather than killing yourself over denial letters at uw. sorry to discourage you, but talent alone or hard work alone or even a combination of those two is not enough to get into the cse department. the only way you are going to get adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted is if you are confident you can study 10 hours a day every day, sacrifice your social life and if you are very talented to begin with (you might be willing to spend 10 h/day studying, but it is harder than it seems. you really need to be comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted). 

also, look into the informatics program before you decide to comMassachusetts Institute of Technology to uw. the program is ok, but for someone like myself, who wanted to do cse their whole life it's just not acceptable. also, talk to one of the cse advisers, they are really helpful, and will tell you how it is. 

the reason i decided to write a comment is because i was much like you before i started uw. the 25% odds didn't discourage me at all, i was always a good student through high school, and am a talented programer. i completed cse 143 with a 3.9, but wasn't as good in calculus, hence i got denied the first time. the second time i applied i was denied because my physics grades weren't good enough. and i don't even know why i was denied the third time. 

i wish you good luck in whatever you decide.

also, see my thread when i last got denied from cse [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/pukir/did_any_one_who_applied_to_cse_hear_back_on_their/)",Comment,Neutral

you'll have a much easier time getting in if you're female. sad but true.

so i'm actually getting an acms degree with an option in discrete math & algorithms. it's the closest thing you can get, you get to take a lot of non-major equivalents to standard cse classes. however there's a lot more math, of course. informatics is another way to go, but that's more businessey rather than programming/math based.

you'll get left behind if you don't have a major by the end of sophomore year, i can almost guarantee it. people say that they change majors in junior and senior year because they found out what they really wanted to do, but then there's no way they're getting out in less than 5-6 years, with or without summer classes.

so, apply to all possible majors that you have prereqs for, and get accepted into multiple majors. then you can choose your favorite later. you're in a bad spot at autumn of junior year without a major.

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/v0il9b/easy_changes_the_uw_could_make_to_improve/,"i think you make some good points, i disagree with 4 and 5 though. i think personal statements are good because it's another metric for them to evaluate you by, as opposed to just taking people with the highest grades. i think that by considering personal statements it shows that applicants are more than just a number to them, which is a good thing imo.

and for 5, i'm not sure why it would be better to have a less precise grading system. as things currently are, if you barely miss a 3.7 you get a 3.6, which is disappointing but not a huge deal. on the letter system, if you barely miss an a-, which corresponds to a 3.7, you end up with a b+, which corresponds to a 3.3. and that gets translated to a number gpa anyways when you apply to grad school, so we might as well use the same metrics in undergrad too.

with regards to the ima ventilation though i think improving that would be huge, it can currently get pretty uncomfy working out in the weight room, especially when the weather is hot or towards the end of the day. and that's only gonna get worse as we go into summer. i also think the unliMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed capacity minor thing is a cool idea that i hadn't really considered, and i'd definitely like to see the uw look more into that.",Comment,Neutral

\#4: debatable. i think the whole essay idea is dumb, but since you only have to do this once in your life it's also not a big deal. though i see your point that this is subjective and can lead to the university adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyting students based on the application-reviewer's bias

\#5: i actually prefer the numerical scale. you may feel less granularity helps because then 3.6 and 3.7 would fall on the same bucket and they represent approximately the same academic performance (i.e.: take 100 clones of yourself, some will get 3.6, some 3.7). but the truth is you'll be taking a 'large number' of courses during your undergrad and the numerical gpa will converge to your average academic performance, which is the only thing the gpa is supposed to represent",Comment,Neutral

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/72vkfi/udub_students_are_you_enjoying_your_time_there/,"graduated last year.

i loved my experience to be honest. but, it wasn't at all what i expected college to be. it also didn't match what most of my friends seemed to experience at other schools. i don't know what it is about uw, i'm guessing it's the size, but it's lacking any semblance of real community. people would just show up for class and go home, it wasn't a fun atmosphere. even in places like the hub, the ""social"" areas were pretty much empty. i never had competition for pool/ping pong tables or the video game room, ever.  

the same could be said of the majors, mine in particular didn't have any home base or events for us to socialize, which was frustrating. i never felt like i was a part of a cohort of students on the same path. there was no way of figuring out who else was in my major or grade in a giant classroom full of overlapping degree paths, without just asking people. 

it's definitely a place where you get to make your own experience though. i made an effort to make friends, mostly by forming study groups, and it worked. at some point though, competition is king and you just have to lock yourself in a room and study.

also, the quarter system sucks so bad and probably adds to things, particularly the competitive aspect. you have 2 months to master material in 3-4 classes. it's also less time spent with the same people, which is less opportunity to develop a friendship before being dumped into another busy quarter with hundreds of new people. 

some of my best friends were international students of the asian variety. i had to work hard to develop those friendships to be honest, there is a pressure for them to form their own groups and stay in them. they're alone in a new country, so of course they're going to bond with someone from their home country. but, they're a huge part of the community, and it's just another division a university that already has no social cohesion.",Comment,Neutral

first off, to your concerns about competition, i knew no shortage of cs hopefuls and i didn't get a sense that anyone was in competition with one another. there was competition with an ""implied other"" in the form of beating the curve, but i saw way more camaraderie between individual students. it was more ""us versus the system"" than ""me versus you"". i don't think you have to worry about it. plus once you're in your major, any need to compete evaporates entirely. uofm undergrads actually felt a little more intense to me; uw undergrads seemed more mellow.

the biggest issue with uw culture was, for me, largely an extension of the seattle freeze. it's hard to talk to strangers on campus, people are really introverted, and i got the sense that a lot of people wanted to just get through their classes so they could go back to their studio apartment up in northgate and be alone. at uofm, it took remarkably little effort to talk to other students on campus. as a grad student i don't really go out of my way to hang out with undergrads, but i got the sense that it would have taken way less work to make plans with people, and even despite my absence of effort i found myself getting roped into things every now and then. at uw, i eventually was able to find a friend group that had the same energy that i did for going out every single day, but it took a bit of effort. it's a big enough school that you can find every single personality type if you look hard enough. living on campus helps a lot with that.

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/t7gc62/uw_good_choice_culture_wise/,"stem is toxic, everything else is fine.   
anyone that does stem is bound to take classes that are curved around a 2.7gpa called weed out classes. these classes effectively make you compete with and ultimately fail other students, as a percentage of students will almost always fail. stem majors are usually capacity-constrained as well, meaning you will have to fight your way to get in (usually with the grades you get from weed out classes). majors typically have different application times from once to four times a year, the more times you get rejected the more you're on a clock. because a good majority of classes that you need to take for that major only lets you take it once you are in the major. once you get rejected enough times, it becomes mathematically impossible to graduate on time due to not having enough time/credits to do all the needed classes.  
if you are dead set on a hyper-competitive major coming into uw and you didn't get direct admission, have at least 2 backup majors, or be prepared to transfer schools.

don't be in a survival and competitive mindset. if you do so, you just become part of the problem. be the solution! learn to love, learn to lead, learn to be kind, the most valuable things in life and the most useful skill to you are probably not determined by what you choose to study, unless your values are fucked up.",Comment,Positive

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/gylygz/a_venting_senior/,"i'm not sure if this would have helped you, but here's a little secret that got me through a lot of the end of undergrad: you can usually get 500-level classes to count towards almost any requirement that 400-level classes do if you get your department to sign off on it.

lots of first-year grad classes (5xx) are curved to a much higher gpa than undergrad classes are (like, 3.5). class sizes are often like seven or something, so you get tons of individual attention. find the ones that aren't core classes, but survey classes taught by a professor in the field. these won't be any harder than a 400-level class and it's usually some professor teaching the *exact* subject the professor studies, so they often put in a disproportionate amount of effort and passion into that tiny class. grad classes in general just have a different vibe and are way more relaxed and collaborative than the competitive feeling in undergrad classes (with the exception of some of the core grad classes that act as weed-outs. grad quantum was the hardest class i ever took, for example). it's also a great way to meet professors, which is good for grad school applications.

it's not really advertised, but it *really* helped me get through my 400-level electives and whatnot.

edit: i also want to say that anyone getting homework back after *weeks* is pure bullshit and really detracts from the learning process. the class i ta'd most of the time in grad school had homework due every class day and i returned it, graded, at the start of the next class day. friday to monday was the longest you'd ever have to wait, because that timely feedback is crucial to understanding. it really sucks you got stuck with a number of classes where homeworks were so delayed in grading.",Comment,Neutral

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ru6d9/frat_life/,"i have a relatively extreme, negative, bias regarding the greek system. however, i will try to provide you with an unbiased opinion on the matter.

there are redditors here that are in frats. some have chimed in.

lets save that first question for later...

does hazing occur? yes, and no. this will depend on the frat itself. i am not familiar with what frat does what, however, you will be able find out simply from asking relatively neutral individuals. it is detrimental to ask people in the greek system because you may get some saying yes, and labeling certain frats so that you think less of them, and some will lie and say no because they are not ""supposed to"" haze anyone. neutral people though will most often tell you a somewhat more honest answer since they dont have as much riding on the answer. this is what i have come across from experience by interacting with both types of people. regardless though, always be a skeptic!

can you party hard? that will depend on your work ethic, major, frat, and responsibility. if you choose a more studious path regarding school, it may be tempting to get sucked in with a frat that has an easier path. ruining your grades. peer pressure is a powerful tool... be careful.

down and alone time? i am not sure. i have never asked anyone about that. most people i run into and hear about are relatively extraverted. every introverted type individual i have spoken with that was in the greek system spoke poorly of it and was on the verge of leaving. it makes sense though, sort of, it is a communal type place. i would imagine it to be difficult if one is introverted and constantly pressured into social interactions. 

how is frat life at uw? well, this is very broad, and very hard to answer. ill try a pro and con approach... 

pro: 

1. networking. this is huge. networking can be very important depending on your major. particularly for business majors. if you are a business major, and you are in a frat, you will most likely be guaranteed some sort of job from a brother of some sort, with recommendations i am sure. meaning, if you were ""like family"" and got at least passing grades they will find you a job. 

2. if you like to party, well, this is where they party... but that is obvious? 

3. the greeks collect tests, quizzes, and other school material. meaning, you will have a considerable edge when it comes to academics. if you use them!! i have met many whom i questioned about their decision to go greek and they always bring that up... 90% though cant even remember what class they ""used the material"" for, meaning, they never used it...

4. i have yet run into a ""bro"" whom i asked if his brothers were reliable in time of need and gotten a no or some half ass answer. get a bad grade? family trouble? get cheated on by some sleezy sorority skank? (it will happen 100% guarantee, ill get back on that later...) the brothers in the frat will always be there to either hook you up with someone, take you out to do whatever you like, cheer you up, etc. meaning, you will get support in the slumps of life. they happen. often, but you will have someone to rely on.

5. if used wisely, it can be a very beneficial tool. many resources that you can use to your advantage. the catch is that you must be wise and have excellent self control. which i believe is incredibly difficult to achieve. it may sound easy, but you would be surprised at how easy it may be to get ""sucked in"" to the very fast life most live and get behind in school.


cons:

1. the greek lifestyle can change people. i have lost several friends to it. intelligent, kind, selfless individuals, whom i thought would never turn into... jersey shore clone douches. the change is unreal. i am not fully certain how it happens, but from my experience, it happens often. at least from everyone that has known people go into the greek system. i believe it stems in a superiority complex, however i have no way of ""proving"" that. it does though happen.

2. if you do party hard and often, you are putting a huge toll on your body. repetitive large consumptions of alcohol and poor sleep patterns will catch up to you and will make your entire life difficult. 

3. if you decide to have a meaningful relationship with a sorority girl, youre gonna have a bad time. this is one of my biggest problems with the greeks. i have met and gotten to know a good number of greek girls, and my god, out of the several dozen, i did not meet a single one that i would want anything to do with. if you want a quickie/hook up then go for it, i guess, it isnt really my thing though. oh yeah, if youre into that, the tridelts are the ones to go to. an ex bro (friend of mine now, actually, hated the system after a year) had a little rhyme for them. ""if youre horny and you know it call a delt... if youre horny and you know it call a delt... if youre horny and you know it and you really want to show it, if your horny and you know it call a delt."" [tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frsm9wggcdo) sing along!! :d

3. the system itself promotes immoral behavior, arrogance, selfishness, greed, elitism, and many other poor characteristic qualities. people that are easily persuaded, and easily ""moved"" will become the stereotypes. i would confidently say that 99% of the people that enter the greek system change for what most, including themselves prior to joining, would consider to be bad people. i cant say 100 because i have this slight glimmer of hope that i will one day meet someone that is in the system that is a tolerable person. i have though met several people that have left the system shattered and thought back on it as a huge mistake...



anyway, i am just starting to ramble, but you get the idea. if you act stupid and make stupid decisions, you will become the stereotype.

if you are really considering joining here is what i would do.

spend a quarter living in a dorm and simply interact with everything in the system. just because you arent part of the greek system doesnt mean you wont be able to talk to them or go to their parties. then after a quarter or two, once you have become accustomed to the schedule and understand your own management of time, consider what frat you have come to see as fitting.

i would not join out of whim without getting to know the school first outside of the greek system. 

lol good memory writing that song part though. was cruising the chevelle over to uvillage when we passed the delts and my friend started singing the song. i was cracking up. also, i am not going to proof read this. i am going to get some food instead.

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ru6d9/frat_life/,"as someone who was once involved in the greek system here is what i have to say:

1. hazing is very real. be careful what house you join and don't be afraid to report hazing if it happens. hazing is a crock of shit and letting it happen to you is perpetuating a dangerous system.

2. you can party hard. one of the few pros i'll give you about the greek system is that you go too hard one of your brothers has your back and will take care of you. but you can find the same thing in the dorms if you are careful.

3. there is plenty of down time in the greek system. sure things can be crazy, but especially if your grades start to suffer there are mandatory study hours in most houses where you are required to log hours of supervised study and what not.  

i guess my ultimate suggestion would be to not do it, but that is shaded by the fact that i was involved in the greek system, had an extremely negative experience in the end, and quit. your experience could be better though. the core of the system has values, values which i still believe are very strong and beneficial, they just get clouded with shit because of social stereotypes and the greeks desire to maintain those shitty stereotypes.

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ru6d9/frat_life/,"i just wrote a very lengthy analysis of the greek system based on the quarter i spent in it, but almost all of that has been covered elsewhere in the thread.

i think the two most important things you should know are as follows:

1: it is very difficult to maintain a sense of your own unique identity in the greek system, not because being different is discouraged, but your hobbies will just become irrelevant. the gs has a way of reducing your life to what the community, as a whole, is centered on: drinking, quasi-apathy towards academics, sports and uhhh... dubstep. your time will be so consumed with the flurry of parties and people that is the greek system that i think you will find it very difficult to retain much of what made you *you* before you joined. it is not, of course, impossible, and this certainly is not the case for everyone in the greek system but just something to be wary of. individuality really tends to wither away, and i think it is really depressing to watch a culture rape a person of their identity and potential in the way that the gs often does. (sorry, biased).

2: strongly related to my first point, the greek system at uw is primarily comprised of wealthy white people from the eastside and california and this plays a big role in the type of environment it is. if you are looking for a robust, diverse melting pot of differing ideas, cultures and backgrounds, you will not find it there. not to say there aren't many wonderful people in the gs, i have lots of friends who live in frats and sororities who are great, but do be cognizant of what much of the community is made up of. the characters of the people i will leave to you to judge, but i will say that there are certain values that run through gs on a subtle level that are directly associated with the type of population it has, and it has a significant effect on the culture there.

(learn how to prioritize activities before it's too late)

in my opinion, college is about getting a ""good education because you have a thirst for knowledge"" along with partying hard! if you're going to college solely for the academic aspect, you're doing it wrong. good study habits, the pursuit of knowledge, and success all come from your own self motivation to succeed in life. think it over, attend rush, and see if there's a house that fits your interests. it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

a few have mentioned that fraternities were full of rich, white kids. i believe that is a very broad generalization, and differs depending on the house you end up in. i chose a house that was comprised of individuals with very different backgrounds. we had rich, white kids from bellevue, poor black kids from tacoma and everything in between. most of the guys in the house worked part-time jobs, and didn't have their parents paying for everything.

i found this diversity created a very real-world situation that helped to prepare me for challenges i later faced in the workplace and in life. not everyone you live with, meet, or work with are going to have the same background, beliefs, and experiences as you.

yes there are some houses where every kid comes from a privileged family on the east side. but to be honest, they have all probably been friends since middle school, and you'd always find yourself on the fringe of their social circles (i.e. you'd be one of these ""smart kids that they recruit"" people are referring to.

i found the 4 years to be an enriching, rewarding experience. my grades weren't as great as they could have been, but it was due to my lack of self-discipline and other activities, not a lack of opportunity the fraternity provided. while i was there, we had a member going through dental school, a few who are now in dentistry and doctor programs here on the east coast, and some pretty bad-ass chemistry majors. fraternity life provides many opportunities to be distracted from your schoolwork, but there are also many things in place to help you get ahead...it's all about balancing and self-discipline.

sororities.
someone below mentioned something along the lines of not being able to have a relationship with someone in a sorority...generalizations like that shouldn't be taken at face value. though i never dated anyone in the greek system, i have plenty of friends who found meaningful (and long-lasting) relationships through it. that may have changed in the past 7 years, and now only sluts and bros are allowed into the greek system, but i doubt it.

my advise to you: don't take the perceived popularity of a house into consideration while you are looking around. what's more important, is finding a group of guys who you see yourself getting along with (for the most part). worst case, you live with some douchebags for 4 years. best case, you make some lifelong friendships. i'm only in contact with 4 or 5 guys on a regular basis (being on the east coast has some affect) today, but i know distance and time won't break those bonds. the rest of the guys i lived with...i'll buy them a beer if i ran into them at a bar, but they were roommates...and good enough guys.",Comment,Neutral

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/8rddso/univ_of_washington_vs_univ_of_connecticut/,"> i'm pretty sure that uconn and uw (if that's the correct abbreviation) are pretty much equal in academics.

by almost any reasonable measure (nrc rankings, publications, citations, grant money, nobel prizes, etc.), uw is far better than uconn (at least in stem fields).  if you plan to go to graduate school, this matters because, all else being equal, an application from a uw graduate will be looked on more favorably than an application from a uconn graduate.

that said, your ability to succeed (in whatever university you choose) will be more important than the name of the university on your college degree.  unfortunately, nobody here can tell you which environment is best for you; that's something you'll have to figure out on your own.

regarding how nyc and seattle compare, they are completely different (i've lived in both cities).  nyc is more crowded, more diverse, more dirty, and the people there are less friendly (at least on the surface).  seattle is more white/asian, cleaner, and it's easier to strike up a conversation here with a random person.  but, the seattle freeze is a real thing; it's kind of hard to make new friends.

uw does have a club hockey team.  but, they don't train near campus (no rink nearby).  if you want to play hockey, you should probably be looking at schools on the east coast or mid-west.",Comment,Neutral

asians are also racist towards each other based on national origin. it's very common.

on a huge note, the racism that asians experience isn't as wide spread or thought about in america as it is between whites and blacks. asian/asian americans don't make much noise about it, but rest assured it exists.

i'll give some examples. asians being called chinks, all look alike, all smart, all good at math or it. asian dudes being joked about having small dicks, lower perception of them in the dating scene. being the 'model' minority. racism towards us being discredited because we are right below whites on the 'totem pole'...yes i have heard that shit. like excuse me? since when is it okay to clump us into this idea of who we are as a whole? it's all racism at the end of the day, even racism dressed like a compliment.",Comment,Neutral

i think overall though, there is less direct racism, and i am pretty white-passing, like you can tell i am not white, but not by that much, so i don't have to experience as much subtle things. i think the real issue is that people hold stereotypes of others on a societal level. like overall people might think certain things even if some people think them a lot less, and it just sucks that people are assuming what you are and what you should be and a lot of the time you need to push or fight to get them to change that view or to prove yourself.",Comment,Neutral

i was in a similar boat, came in with 2/3 intro math done, had been exposed to mechanics, and had chemistry ap credit. 

so here we go, don't take math 126 first quarter, take it spring quarter if possible. this will line up with all other freshman and ensures you're not competing with sophomores who know what they're doing. 

at most take 2, 5 credit intro per quarter and have the last one be an easy vlpa course. 

don't take cs 143x. you're competing with everyone else who has done programming before. 

edit: also look up your teachers and ask around for teacher recommendations/ teacher to avoid. a lot of teachers will set their grading schemes differently. so look for a forgiving one. 

don't buy textbooks if you can find them online. unless you like paper copies. 

if you hate your teacher try going to a lecture taught by someone else if possible. this is super prevalent for intro courses. 

study smart, not hard. use solutions and copious examples to get you through. ask for help. form study groups. leave bad study groups. go back and redo homework you got wrong. practice tests. if a teacher gives you a practice test do it, even if that is the only practice you do. talk to the people who sit next to you in class (try to sit in the same seat every time). for christs sake do all the homework. 

uw is not impossible. it has great resources and great people that are incredibly passionate. you can see this in just the type of clubs that we offer. in regards to engineering there is rocketry (sarp), concrete canoe, hyperloop, dbf (robotics kinda), ecocar, and formulae (race cars). 

now gpa is important. but you don't need a 4.0. i got into cs with a 3.5. and i never programmed before college. 

other things to keep note: 
the cs department is growing and will ideally be accepting more people in 2-3 years. these are tips that are applicable to any university. in any case you will excel when you study smart. however in the uw, to get into select engineering major, excelling in required. 

i love my school. i've met fabulous people and have learned so much and have found myself enjoying things i've never had exposure to. it took me 2 years to get in a groove, and to learn how to study smart. but it is very much doable. there are so many opportunities present at the university. do your research before you pick. and feel free to ask me anything.

the only possible indicator of success that i've seen seems to be how hard you studied in high school. not how many classes you took or how good your grades were, but on a day to day basis, how much you actually put time into learning and understanding the material and practicing everything before tests. did you ever find your classes stressful? the people i know who typically pull 2.5-3.0's are the ones who took a lot of ""hard"" classes in high school, and consistently got high grades with very little studying.",Comment,Neutral

University of Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/60a1v6/kind_of_scared_of_coming_to_udub_could_you_please/,"to be completely honest with you, you go to college for the paper degree, experiences, resources, and perhaps the name. 

cons of uw:
you're guaranteed to waste two years at a university cause you'll be taking ""general education"" requirements, which means vlpa, i&s, natural world, etc...  people will always say ""well it was an eye-opening experience for me"". it's not worth paying 4k for gen ed classes when you can do that at community college for cheaper, wait till you get accepted into a program at a university so you can just pay and invest time in classes in your major. as for in-major classes, computer science, you can generally teach yourself those skills. moreover, at times, in competitive majors, it may seem like everyone is competing against one another and not willing to help each other out. it gets lonely at times and it can be devastating not to get into a major of your choice. you can work your ass off, but if you're not on top of the curve or if you can produce results, many of the advisers and faculty have no patience or  advice for you other than ""well, you can retake the class and do better"". overall, uw can be straight up savage, especially to those who struggle with school and are socially awkward or introverted.
so to bullet point it:
-high cost (esp. outside of state students and esp. if you can get into your intended major after freshmen or sophomore year)
-application required to get into competitive majors
-weed out classes
-uw doesn't craft spectacular and innovative students. those students were already on the track to being successful. 
-can be hard for introverted students, especially in shitty weather here.
-result based rather than process based. can put in hard work, but if you don't do well on midterms or finals (meaning get ahead of the curve in most weed out classes) you're doomed for low grades.
-useless ""general education"" classes that optimists will always say ""look on the bright side! they weren't a complete waste of time"". for students whom were privileged to afford taking those classes, good for them, for those who are on a financial crunch, not so good. 

pros of uw:
-the resources here. there are ample clubs, help centers, rooms you can book, many places to study, the ima, career fairs, etc... there are resources here that you can't get by being at cc.
-the big campus vibe. to be lost in a big campus is amazing. you can make a big campus small, but you. ant make a small campus big.
-the scenery. oh my goodness, when there is sun, campus is amazingly beautiful. spring, summer, and a bit of autumn at uw are beautiful.
-the parties and friends. if you're able to assimilate and make a good group of friends, you'll be guaranteed to have a good time at uw. uw students in general are pretty nice and there's always some event going on around campus. uw is a great place to network.

overall, uw is overall a great culture if you take advantage of the resources. your motivation and self-confidence will be put to the test at uw. if you have the resilience and the support of friends and family to push through, you'll have a great time at uw. if money and if education is top priority and you have the motivation to succeed regardless of where you go, uw might not be the place for you. 

and to answer your question since i realized i didn't answer it. acceptance into your desired major is not guaranteed. you could do average or above average and it's still not guaranteed to get you in. that's the risk you take with uw. admission rates are low with competitive majors, about 20-30% acceptance rate, sometimes even lower due to students whom apply and reapply and reapply again and again.

my brother, on the other hand, was not as lucky. he spent is first year without a major and it was a living hell. he couldn't get into any of the classes that he needed so basically wasted his first year taking credits that weren't even important. since he was a commuter student and his schedule was trash, you would usually wake up at five in the morning and be home at nine in the evening or later. after getting into his major, everything changed, and his experience at uw got infinitely better.

additionally, college can be a stressful time in general. when you're a senior in high school, you are stressed about getting into the college of your choice. as a freshman/sophomore, your stressed about getting into the major of your choice. finally, in your junior year and beyond your stressed about getting that internship or job that usually a thousand other people also applied to.",Comment,Neutral

it shouldn't be hit or miss on whether you get in a major or not. if you put in the work and demonstrate your passion in a field, you should be allowed into that major. i literally had a 3.8 gpa, 80 college credits from running start, good extra curriculars, and taken at least 5 cs/programming courses with a 3.8 overall in those courses alone. i didn't get da with an appeal. 

that shit is ridiculous, and what's worse is i know there are people currently in the major who hadn't taken a single cs course until they got to uw and got da. it makes you feel like shit when stuff like this happens after going years to prove what you want to do and then get swatted like a fly, for no reason at all.

it s okay to be sad or mad over a bad grade or a situation that might not be ideal, but you re here at the university and you are very privileged for that. there are so many people who are incredibly less fortunate than us and i m not talking about people who might be going to a college with lower prestige or whatever. i m talking about kids in third world countries and across the globe, including the united states, who are robbed of the opportunity to even pursue an education, let alone a nationally renowned higher education.

so suck it up, yes shit might suck, but stop being a damn simp. 

to freshman: this school is hard, but as cliche as it sounds, nothing is impossible, especially not some grades in school if that s what you care about or reaching some desired career. you re never fucked until you believe you re fucked and give up.

but overall compared to my alma mater (i m at uw for a second degree) i just get the vibe of pretentiousness, hostility, and just an overall cut throat sink or swim mentality here. this is good and bad. feel like anyone could have made it through my old school by just showing up, and i did want a more competitive academic environment but damn... guess i should ve known what i m getting myself into. i will be proud to graduate from here. but i don t think i would do it again if i could go back. it s almost like they want to get rid of people here, but i guess the standard is the standard and they have to draw their line and stick to it. sorry for the ramble i just have mixed emotions about my experience here haha.

another thing... instructors and tas don t have time for students here. it s really frustrating. back at my old school tas would do problem sets until 1am. here you get an hour per week for 80 students. like the content is already hard enough and i m paying to learn from experts... make yourselves available",Comment,Neutral

(although if you can't visit don't worry, you can still make a good decision by weighing the factors you have available.)

i think cal's competitive reputation is somewhat overblown. eecs is a demanding major, and there are major stressors on classes both from academic and administrative standpoints, but overall i found the eecs community much more collaborative and welcoming than competitive. yes, there will be assholes, but they aren't the majority --and in general i felt that i could always turn to my classmates and tas for help and advice. (pro-tip: go to office hours! that's where i met the best study-buddies.) and honestly i would expect University of California Los Angeles cs to be subject to the same pressures.

berkeley cs is more prestigious than University of California Los Angeles, but University of California Los Angeles is also highly regarded. i know plenty of people who went through both programs and ended up at facebook, google, etc. -- also people who went on to prestigious grad schools.

as it currently stands, the economics and business economics major is largely theoretical economics concepts (1, 2) coupled with a sprinkling of accounting (mgmt), calculus (11, 101, 102), and statistics (41, 103, 104).  the degree frankly doesn't go into any of these subjects in much depth or to the extent where this will translate to a singular marketable skill but rather serves as a ""math lite esque"" major without the quantitative rigor of a stem degree.

it also serves to pigeonhole individuals into a very generalist degree when a majority of the requisite courses are just filler classes.  as someone going into accounting, i don't need half a dozen calculus or coding courses to perform the functions of my job.  conversely, someone going into marketing or real estate doesn't need the quantity of rigorous accounting courses required for the business economics major.  however, courses teaching data analysis, interpersonal communication, and basic excel are not even included in the core curriculum.

furthermore, many lucrative career opportunities in fields such as corporate finance, investment banking, management consulting, and project management are not available to individuals who aren't able to secure positions in the highly competitive business clubs at this school, especially for transfer students and people who aren't entirely set on a single field.  coupled with a career center that provides very little value, this serves to greatly liMassachusetts Institute of Technology the job opportunities people can choose from post-graduation.

speaking from personal experience and as a soon-to-be graduating senior, i can say that despite these factors, i still have pursued multiple leadership roles in clubs, networked and made lifelong friends with my peers, and secured a job in a career field that i am passionate about.  i would even argue that the sparse institutional resources that the school provides forces students to be adaptive, creative, and resilient when pursuing their individual goals, but this is just my two cents.

one of my best friends went to Stanford University  and hates it there and he says he wished he went to University of California Los Angeles. this is definitely due to him pursuing  college politics and let me tell you, the college political field in Stanford University  is incredibly shady and there are some institutional norms that have been ingrained to put you down if you are a person of color (all anecdotal from my friend). of course anecdotes aren't the best form of evidence but again my friend's story is all about his path. he chose to go down his path and it showed him that Stanford University  is not all sunshine and rainbows as it seems. 

most people in University of California Los Angeles came to pursue a science degree, which is honestly not all that well managed, hence all the feedback on this post telling you to go elsewhere because of everyone's collective experience with how the school handles its science (specifically premed) students. as someone who switched from the  hard sciences to the social sciences, i can definitely see those flaws in the system. the social sciences are actually very rewarding and flexible in my experiences that i'm actually starting to enjoy my stay in University of California Los Angeles. coupled with the fact that that i have made many lasting memories, i could definitely say that i did not make a mistake choosing University of California Los Angeles.",Comment,Neutral

many undergrads think name and gpa matter but the truth is nobody gives a fuck about these things other than scholarship opportunities. even graduate school can be flexible if you do well on entrance exams and demonstrate a strong extracurricular resume in research or advocacy. you need to think about what tangible pathways are available to you based on your interests. companies, non-profits etc are being faced with many millennials, gen z, etc students pouring out of top schools across the us. you ll need more than a prestigious name - whatever school will help you cultivate your identity and brand will give you the edge regardless whether you re from University of California Los Angeles or Stanford University . 

also think about climate. i know some friends who went to ivy leagues and were miserable, didn t find connections, and did poorly as a result. you need to assess fit and culture as well. what sort of things do you need in an educational community? intellectual rigor? cultural diversity? conservative, progressive, alternative? these matter so much.

people tend to have more of a grass-is-greener, glass-is-half-empty type attitude, especially when they're undergoing the stress of going through something like a premed curriculum or some other really tough major.  but once a person, in this case a University of California Los Angeles undergrad, is, say, five years out of college, and say done with grad school and training -- probably not in your case, then he/she will look back with fondness at the university and really miss it, and i mean really miss it.

i know this is not socially correct to state, but when i graduated from University of California Los Angeles and entered the real world -- and fairly immediately, i thought of all the incredibly hot collection of women who were at University of California Los Angeles (not all but most) and thought about all the missed opportunities because i was pursuing and had my eye on someone else. (i'm guy and don't have any questions about my gender, and University of California Los Angeles is still quite decisively hetero despite its rainbow emblem -- i don't know if that's just linkedin.) 

i thought to myself and reflected on the things i took for granted that i had having attended University of California Los Angeles: the collection of beautiful women, no Stanford University  or berkeley googles needed; the perfect 82 degrees w/o a cloud in the sky as per my name; the 100+ upper-division economics courses from which to choose with everything one needed for an incredible business education; the incredible food, with things like (edit:braised) short ribs and kosher and vegan dishes; the beautiful view from the top of janss steps (or whatever they'll be calling it); the incredible winding drive down sunset when my friends and i left campus on a getaway, and when we would come back and see the top of powell from over mile off; people lying in sunset rec, with people recreating, swimming, playing beach volleyball;  people reclining on the incline by the steps taking in the sun, people resting and reading in the sculpture garden; all the incredible events in ackerman; road trips up to the norcal schools for football and seeing how good University of California Los Angeles students have it; driving to venice beach, will rodgers, and driving up the coast to zuma; having dinner with strangers and listening to the host tell about how he started a business by studying stem; the diversity -- jewish, persians, arabs armenians;  south and east asians, blacks, whites, latinas/os; first-generation, multi-generational college students;  internationals from around the globe, students from the east coast and the south, all whom by and large get along really well, and all of whom are very attractive; speakers in meyerhoff park; all the various clubs that a student could ever need; taking hikes to the hollywood sign and seeing a grand view of the city, or in the hills of malibu and seeing a grand view of the ocean; experiencing all the wonderful ethnic foods in la -- farmer's market; ethiopian; indian; asian noodles, pho, ramen; korean bbq; and all the other more standard ethnic foods ... anyway, i can go on and on. 

absolutely, Stanford University  >> University of California Los Angeles for academics, but Stanford University  doesn't have the total ""feels"" that University of California Los Angeles has.  not even close.

but also remember that Stanford University  has large classes as do the ivy schools.  the average class size for cs there is over 120.  for University of California Los Angeles it's about the same; but not like berkeley's \~ 500.  and for premed, all are in the same boat of having to maintain high grades and mcat scores. and you're not going to become brighter by attending Stanford University .  go where you'll be happiest.",Comment,Positive

yeah the big classes are a lot, but i enjoyed getting to meet a lot of different people from all over from such diverse but also sometimes similar backgrounds.

University of California Los Angeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of California Los Angeles/comments/22yr96/how_much_debt_is_University of California Los Angeles_worth/,"

this is a tough decision. to me it seems like you really want to go to University of California Los Angeles, but are having trouble justifying the cost. 

here are some things to consider about University of California Los Angeles, and more specifically the english department:

* University of California Los Angeles is a *much* more prestigious school than ucr. it has a better reputation within california, and it is also more well known nationally and internationally. 
* living in la will give you more opportunities to pursue a writing/editing/journalism career
* University of California Los Angeles has a great network of respected english teachers
* University of California Los Angeles does have a creative writing concentration within the english major (however you have to apply to each creative writing class individually by subMassachusetts Institute of Technologyting a sample work and other information. each creative writing class only has ~15 students. there are only a handful of creative writing classes offered each quarter. this is the most competitive aspect of being an english major. even if you get into a creative writing class one quarter, it does not guarantee that you will get into a different creative writing class the next quarter)
* the english major itself is not that competitive right now, at least not for current students (you literally just have to tell your counselor you want the major and they put you in right away). i don't know how competitive it is for transfer students.
* the University of California Los Angeles english department is quite large. there are so many different classes offered each quarter with a lot of flexibility in the requirements. there are so many professors that you could be a senior english major talking to another senior english major, and only have 1-2 professors in common.
* the University of California Los Angeles lower division english classes (a series of 3 mandatory introductory courses) tend to be on the larger side (could be 100+ students), but the upper division classes (more specific topics) tend to be on the smaller side (anywhere from 15-80, but average is probably closer to 40). 
* most of the University of California Los Angeles english professors are really great and willing to help you get involved in research, internships, etc.

obviously these are all pluses, and you seem like you don't really need convincing that University of California Los Angeles is a great option.

the main downside would be money. ultimately money does matter, and 10k is *a lot* of money. especially considering the fact that you want to go into a field that does not have high salary potential, at least not starting off. 

if you do decide to go to University of California Los Angeles, you need to start figuring out how to make up the difference immediately. this is the type of action you should be taking if that is your choice:

* personally call up the financial aid office (do it this week!) and see if there is any possible way to get more money. they might turn you on to scholarship opportunities. continue to call the financial aid office every new quarter. 
* look for outside scholarships and apply! even if they are only for a small amount of money, even if you have to write a dumb essay. it is so worth it in the end. 
* find a part time job within your first quarter - but keep in mind this will make it more difficult to keep on top of your academic and social life.
* take advantage of the opportunities at University of California Los Angeles. if you go there and don't push yourself to try new things, build relationships with professors, etc. it might not be worth it.

i would also recommend that you look into the possibility of graduating in three years. the University of California Los Angeles english major requirements are not that extensive: 

* 4-5 lower division classes (depending on if you get credit for some through ap tests)
* 10 upper division classes
* 10 classes required for general education classes (although if you sign up for a ge cluster your freshman year, some classes count for more than one requirement). 
* the total number of classes would ~25. if you have passed multiple ap test, that gets lowered pretty easily
* if you budgeted 3 classes per quarter (most people take 3-4 classes), that would land you at 27 classes in three years. however, that would probably not satisfy the unit minimum. 
* the college unit minimum is 180 units. each ge is 4-5 units and most english classes are 5 units. you could easily add in an extra class each quarter your 2-3 years, or take summer classes if necessary.

ok i may have overwhelmed you with information, but i was just trying to be as thorough as possible. i definitely think it *could* be worth it to go to University of California Los Angeles over ucr, but only if you take the initiative to *make* it worth it.

i'm from the riverside area and i'm a second year now in la. i got into both schools but the one thing that i feel make la the more obvious choice, ignoring prestige etc etc, was the opportunities available in los angeles. riverside is a great city, but it doesn't have the almost chaotic hustle and bustle los angeles has. you have a much larger window of meeting people that are relevant to whatever you're studying in los angeles, be it medicine, theatre, accounting, even writing. riverside isn't exactly the destination where the best of whatever sector you're interested are scurrying off to. ronald reagan, beverly hills, downtown, stifling traffic! whether or not you branch out is up to you, but the opportunities are endless here if you look for them.",Comment,Positive

1. University of California Los Angeles is **far** more prestigious and challenging than ucr is.  the type of student and the type of professors at University of California Los Angeles will push you far more than than anyone will at ucr.  people recognize this and this is why University of California Los Angeles is increasingly being recognized as one of the best schools not only just in the country, but in the world.

2.  University of California Los Angeles's network.  the network is massive at University of California Los Angeles.  through alumni connections and recruiters, it will be much easier to get internships while at school and jobs after you graduate.  University of California Los Angeles alum recruit heavily from the school, you get to meet and develop relationships with people who can help you down the road, and major companies hire people out of University of California Los Angeles.  when i was in school, i was able to leverage this and was able to get internships and finally a job right out of school that were not related to my major (working in business at a startup now).  the University of California Los Angeles network is great.

3.  flexibility and options.  you should also consider the fact that you may end up changing majors once in school.  you might not be even thinking about that right now, but tons of kids end up changing once in school.  if that's ever the case, University of California Los Angeles will provide you more opportunities than ucr will.  any degree from University of California Los Angeles will be more valuable than if you switch to something else at ucr.  plus, you'll have the internships and research opportunities to go along with any switch at University of California Los Angeles.  imo, University of California Los Angeles offers more flexibility in this case.

4.  los angeles.  you get to live in one of the largest cities in the country and a major hub of culture.  the entertainment and social opportunities are liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyless and you can find whatever fits your specific wants and desires.  plenty of concerts, lots of art, great food from every cuisine, very multicultural, and great sports.  sure there's traffic, but you get used to it and once you do, la is fantastic.  plus, the weather's always nice and the beach is only a stone's throw from campus.


i had some friends who went to ucr because they got more money from them and they hated it there.  they felt that they weren't challenged enough ever and they felt constrained in riverside.  in terms of riverside, i grew up near there, and it's pretty boring.  really not much to do there, definitely more of a desert environment, and a lot less jobs out there.  if i were you, i'd take University of California Los Angeles.  imo it's worth the extra money.",Comment,Positive

so the creative writing classes are workshops, and each take only 11-12 students a quarter (the official class listing says 15 but that's only for the wait list. it is a little bizarre why they just don't do a 12 person class with a 3 person wait list but whatever). it's by application only and is open to all University of California Los Angeles students that have satisfied the writing ii requirement (which is not covered by ap credit btw). so it's fairly competitive to get in (the professors are all usually fairly successful/well known writers so their standards are super high). it's a ton of work, but the experience definitely is rewarding, as you get to build friendships with a bunch of other people who have a passion for creative writing. but the classes are less of teaching you creative writing and honing your existing skills and tackling specific aspects of your writing. 
there is also a creative writing club on campus that gets together every week to write and share stories and poems and other creative works, as well as teach creative writing to local schools (from 5th graders all the way up to high school). so even if you don't get into the class, you have plenty of places to make friends with writers and share your work! 

to get the creative writing concentration, you need to take 3 workshops (with a minimum of two different professors). there is also the option to do a longer, creative writing thesis as part of the honors curriculum. 

the english department here at University of California Los Angeles is fantastic. the counselors here are fantastic. the professors are fantastic (i've had yet to have a terrible professor in the english department). the tas are awesome and actually care about you doing well and often go the extra mile to help you out if you ask. seriously, you're in the heart of movie/television industry and la has such a thriving creative community, if creative writing is the thing you want to do, la is an awesome place to be.

University of California Los Angeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of California Los Angeles/comments/22yr96/how_much_debt_is_University of California Los Angeles_worth/,"something you should consider:
as an out of state student you are expected to pay a lot of tuition every quarter (almost the double of normal tuition - you are paying private school fees at this point). but apart from the extra cost of University of California Los Angeles you should also factor in the fact that rent and food and in general living costs are significantly higher in University of California Los Angeles than in riverside. that being said - if you can afford the expense go with University of California Los Angeles. 

my opinion:
imho, you should plan not to have any debt as you graduate. after your 3-4 years in college think of the sort of work you can realistically get and how many years it will take to repay those loans - and take the worst case scenario. i would personally rather have the freedom of not having to earn a 100k over a 4 year period to pay loans.

you wrote about the communities and opportunities for experiences. while they are very important part of your college life - will not directly get you work after you graduate (which is what you need if you have a lot of debt). so, i better route is find a community college in the la area - work hard, do well - transfer to University of California Los Angeles. 

another thing to keep in mind- with the amount of money for tuition (out of state for University of California Los Angeles) you are talking of - you can study abroad. sometimes even for cheaper: places like germany, sweden don't even have tuition - but as an english major you would want to look at the uk or ireland i assume.

lot of clubs out there, lot of things to do, and great city for work experience/internships. but active campus life lol. i think only 10% of the student population is involved in greek life,  sports are there but i don't know if there's ever a crowd that comes out to cheer our teams on. basically, you'll go through phases of finding friends, losing them, making new friends, and whining about the lack of community. 

however, i think other people failed to mention that there are colleges in/around nyc that have a decent campus life. if you want to stay in manhattan, i would look into Columbia University university- there's actually a gated campus, and a smaller student population. also, i'd look into fordham/pace as well. but there are other urban areas that do a better job with a legit campus (philly, dc). eh, i would still apply and see what the financial aid package is, so good luck!

1. if you want to experience the urban space, there is perhaps nowhere better than new york city. 

2. an interest in international anything makes New York University a top choice; it has streamlined study abroad opportunities, and certain majors build internationalism explicitly into its core. see: [business and political economy](http://www.stern.New York University.edu/programs-admissions/undergraduate/academics/bs-degree-business-and-political-economy/semesters-abroad) and [global liberal studies](https://liberalstudies.New York University.edu/academics/gls-curriculum/concentrations.html)

3. class sizes are not going to be as small as they might be at your typical slac, but they can be quite intimate depending on your program. the largest classes i had were lower level philosophy courses in cas, but even those break out into much smaller recitations; meaning that while lectures were large, the ""small class"" element was still present. my senior thesis seminar had like 5 people... plenty of my other courses throughout the years had around 15-20.

4. it's possible, and recommended, to forge close relationships with professors, particularly if you're interested in further studies. but it doesn't happen automatically. much like the real world, building relationships will take a little bit of energy on your part. i still keep in touch with three or four of my professors from New York University, despite having graduated ~3 years ago.

5. it's entirely possible to be active in clubs, but New York University doesn't have a ""student body"" insofar as it has various enclaves of student activity. if you get involved in campus politics: you'll find a very active community. if you get involved in sports: you'll find an active community. if you get involved with the student paper(s): you'll find an active community. but there isn't really an umbrella community that touches on all these things at once... 

6. New York University is not cozy in the sense that it is labyrinthine halls of old wood and dark reading nooks. cozy space exists on campus, but it's not really cozy as a whole. bobst is a great library, although it can get crowded particularly around exam time.

in summation, if you're looking for a university with a lot to offer and are mature enough to seek out and utilize resources on your own, and are interested in international aspects of university, New York University is a great place to be. if you're a self-starter, it can be great. if you're expecting things to fall into your lap or have your hand held through the college process...

premed advising - people's opinions are very mixed here, so i'd advise you to check out the advising center yourself. i have gone couple of times and mostly came out with no new information but more like confirmation of what i knew. they're very nice though and they're very willing to help.

chances to be in hospitals are huge bc you're in nyc and theres so many hospitals, like northwell, New York University langone, mount sinai, etc. if you sign up in their prehealth letter they send out every thursday they list all the clinical and research volunteer available.

required classes is just pretty standard. year of bio, 2.5 years chem, year of physics, year of english, semester of sociology or psychology, and year of math (but usually people complete this with ap credits). think you can check out the list in their page actually.

for cs, you need to be pretty smart, and/or manage your time well to do well in all your courses + premed courseload. keep in mind, only like 10-20% of each cs class will get an a in the class, especially for the harder courses, so it's not a cakewalk. same goes for premed itself. by itself premed and cs are difficult programs to do well in, except with cs your gpa matters far far less, and grading is thus far less lenient too. 

doable? yes. recommended? fuck to the no. i'd also recommend to go to the cheapest easiest state school you can for premed, but that's a whole other discussion.",Comment,Neutral
New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/gtqjxe/comp_sci_premeds_how_is_it/,"just graduated this semester. took all the premed courses except pob 2 and biochem. this is because i decided to stick with cs at the end. generally, it s doable if you manage your time properly. but there are some issues i encountered that, had i known about them, might have reconsidered my path. 

the first has to do with letters of recommendation for medical school. not taking higher level chem/bio/physics courses meant that i didn t really get too close to any professors in these departments. the intro level premed courses include a huge number of students which can make it difficult to get a professor s attention. when a professor doesn t really know you, it s more difficult for them to write good letters of recommendation. if you re going to continue on this path, start thinking about this now while you have options. some medical schools require letters from professors of premed related course and may not accept letters from professors of cs courses. 
 
secondly, at the end of my undergrad career, i decided to go to grad school for cs instead. however, because i was taking premed courses in addition to being a cs major, i did not enroll in the honors program for cs and therefore did not work on research and/or do a thesis. it s worth noting that you don t have to be in the honors program in order to do research. the point is, having these things (research and cs with honors/thesis) would have helped with grad school. 

the larger point i m trying to make is that if you can see yourself comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyting to either one of these fields in the future, do that now and give it your all. but i don t regret doing both. i had fun and would probably do it again, maybe with just a few adjustments. if you feel the same way too, then best of luck. 

ps: if you do continue with cs, beware of professor shoup for basic algorithms. he has crazy hard problems sets that will make you question your decisions. but he does curve somewhat generously...sometimes...i think. he did for us. also, professor jones is awesome for orgo, don t let anybody tell you otherwise. you just have to practice a lot and live and breath the textbook. good luck!",Comment,Neutral

 i've been trying to decide if i want to apply to cas or tandon, and i'm kind of stuck. 

1. are there dorms at tandon? will i live there or still live on the main campus? 


2. is it possible for me to transfer from tandon to cas or vice versa if i decide i want to change freshmen year? 


3. tandon's acceptance rate is a bit higher than cas, that's kind of a selling point for me because i don't have the greatest stats. [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/applyingtocollege/comments/605j3h) a link to my stats, ignore the rest of the info) do you think i have a somewhat decent chance of getting into tandon? 

i'm definitely leaning towards tandon, between the classes, the bs, the acceptance rate, and the overall school. the only thing i still don't love is the distance, but you've helped me feel better about that.

2. you still use the ba vs bs argument even though a google search shows how insignificant the title difference is. you overstate the difference calling a bs ""sexy"". difficulty in transferring usually means how difficult it is to get into the school not the difference in classes. cas students have higher average stats and standardized test scores so an average tandon student would have a difficult time transferring in to cas. there are many people who transfer schools and completely switch majors; that doesn't mean it's more difficult to transfer schools. there is no reference where that 35% comes from, i saw it in the google side bar too but there is nothing that supports that number. for New York University, the usnews ranking site supports New York University's acceptance rate on the sidebar and we know that usnews gets official data from colleges.

3. everyone likes to think they have the toughest time at New York University. each individual has their own strength and weaknesses. when you're surrounded by mostly humanities majors, it's no surprise they say say it looks ""hard"".

the main things that are attractive about tandon to me are as follows:
a) the i^2e concept, in that it seems as though the classes are designed to help you thrive in a innovative field as opposed to working behind a desk doing the same design worm your whole career
b) the location is very nice. the whole environment in brooklyn right now seems to be very inviting for tech start-ups (which is where i want to find myself after school) and the connections that can be made through the school are seemingly invaluable 
c) it is an opportunity to get away from the ""machine"" that is most engineering schools here in the midwest

however, i'm turned away for equally important reasons, which are as follows:
a) in high school (i'm currently a senior) i am a pretty normal if not ""popular"" kid. i drink, party, have a big group of friends, etc. i'm worried that i won't be able to find other students who aren't so nerds, and from a lot of posts it seems like the majority of kids are playing video games when they're not in class
b) the money, but it's not a super huge deal
c) tandon's rigor in terms of courses and diploma strength (in that it may not be too challenging or strong enough of a school yet)

New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/j3lx6o/rant_about_cas_cs_and_the_career_fair/,"haha yeah New York University cs is seriously fucked up in more than a few ways. career stuff is definitely one of them. New York University cas has a very mediocre reputation among tech companies. my friend at bloomberg was surprised to learn that New York University is not a target school. we're a school in new york, with a top business school and a good math program, what's not to like? well, there's a few things. 

unfortunately a lot of New York University cs students are weak. they're not properly prepared by courses and despite the efforts of some great people at the New York University cs clubs, they don't write code outside of class. this is partially because we don't get the superstars who have been programming since high school, and partially because New York University doesn't encourage it.

also it's important to realize that recruiting and career stuff ranks exactly zero in the priorities of New York University's cs department. cs ranking is about academic concerns like research and papers published. who cares if students get jobs? i doubt more than 2 or 3 tenured professors (i.e. the people who actually have power) have worked as a programmer. honestly half the department is applied math just masquerading as cs.

tandon, surprisingly, has a decent rep among companies. i've been impressed with some of their placements. they're also an engineering school which does provide a degree of rigor. i've also heard that they had a good rep as poly, which carried over to tandon.

i started [my blog](https://blog.torchNew York University.com/) to encourage students to think about their career and apply to internships. if you notice, i don't ever recommend using New York University's resources. that's because they're terrible and catered to the lowest common denominator. i've never used them and i don't think any of my classmates who got good internships did either.",Comment,Neutral

for one, it's easier to get a research opportunity than an internship through New York University...

although the career fair sucks there are lots of individual recruiting events advertised through handshake/piazza careers like hackathons and meet&greets where you can leave your resume and ask questions. (not just startups either, i've gotten emails from morgan stanley, jp morgan, facebook, barclays, google, ebay) we also have wasserman appointments, vmock, biginterview which i've found quite helpful for interviews and resumes. even more helpful might be the various professional clubs and the faculty/alumni network. in terms of resources we have, it could be a lot worse.

even at another school with better resources a lot of it still comes down to the students being proactive. no school is going to dm recruiters after the career fair or do online assessments for you. it's disheartening how much we're expected to do on our own just for an internship but i'm not sure the grass is much greener on the other side.",Comment,Neutral

(1) courant is located within the school of arts and sciences, a research based institution. it is not a trade school whose purpose is to find you a job. of course, that is the end goal for most students, but the school's focus is not career based. it is a liberal arts-based program designed to teach you to think and problem-solve.  neither type of program is ""better.""  they are just different. it just depends on what you are looking for.

(2) a lot of the complaints on this thread seem to come from people who came to the school not realizing this. one of the commenters in particular seems to have made it his hobby to criticize the program because it does not meet his needs, which has long had me wondering why he didn't do more research before applying and why didn't he transfer after realizing the program was not for him.

(3) in terms of job opportunities, the department has a listerv that regularly sends out emails from companies looking to hire New York University cs students. they come so often it actually gets annoying. 

(4) at New York University getting a research position is a simple matter of emailing a professor and asking. it is a great way to get work experience and to make connections with the faculty, who can then assist you in the job hunt.  my New York University student got 3 cs research positions with literally zero effort beyond asking. 

(5) there are countless huge companies that recruit New York University students but no job will be handed to you on a silver platter (same as at every other school). it  requires extensive work on your resume (with wasserman); networking through linkedin; working on side projects; joining the programming team; doing  research into what companies were looking for;  preparing extensively for the interview process; and studying hard for good grades.  

(6) could the New York University career fair be better? i'm sure it could be! but the unfounded negativity on this post is so absurd as to almost be comical.  things like  ""mediocre reputation among tech companies"" because  it (supposedly) is not a target school of bloomberg.  and ""a lot of New York University students are weak""  what does that even mean?  how on earth would you know this?  ""recruiting ranks zero""  again, comical.  so future readers, please take it all with a giant grain of salt.  sure, some people are not happy but do your own research from verifiable sources.  is New York University the right cs program for you?  maybe or maybe not, but that will depend on what you are looking for.",Comment,Neutral

New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/4re4rh/should_i_leave_New York University/,"hey op. New York University alum from the class of 2013 here. i applied to transfer out at the end of freshman year and was accepted to a competitive program at Cornell University. i turned it down last minute and i am glad i did. some things for you to meditate on:

1) lsp: i've heard things about this program, but if you plan to go onto grad school or major in a field not directly linked to a job path (ex. economics which is what i majored in and have had a great career albeit unrelated as a result), enjoy the grade inflation. New York University publishes gpa averages and you'll only look great with a better one.

if you need more stimulation, try to sign up for work study or get an awesome internship or research position in the city. you'll learn a ton and expand your network. which brings me to my next point.

2. the people: yes New York University is super liberal which can be great but also excessive. i was also from a conservative small town and had a bit of culture shock but i am happy for it in retrospect. the great thing about nyc is that there's a social group for everyone but sometimes it takes a big of soul searching and effort to find them.

many people don't even hang out with other New York University students. i made a small group by living in the dorms and making friends in class, but my friends were largely met via clubs and internships. which brings me to my next point.

3. roommates can suck: i became bffs with my freshman year roommate but then absolutely hated my sophomore year roommate. we're talking screaming matches (she left used tampons on the floor--wtf) and i had another roommate who'd get angry at her boyfriend and throw stuff at the walls.

it sucks but the dorms give you access to a network of people. after my second year i moved off campus but living in dorms helps you meet people and also it's just a good life lesson in learning how to deal with obnoxious people. no matter where you work or go in life, i guarantee you'll face more frustration in dealing with people, and it stinks but helps you learn patience and tolerance. move off campus junior or senior year and you won't regret it.

4. the culture: New York University isn't cheap and so this will be a good life lesson in dealing with people who have greater means. i went to New York University on scholarship so i also felt weird with the judgment, but you'll learn to empathize with people from different backgrounds.

New York University also has an incredibly culturally diverse community, so i'd try to also talk to some international students or learn to tolerate people who have more/less family money. if it bothers you that much, hang in the commuter lounge.


feel free to dm me if i can help with any other perspective. leaving New York University for me personally was the easy way out but i built a lot of character and strength for toughing it out and building my own path. after i graduated i took a job in seattle and even moved back to nyc because i missed it so much from my great time during my final New York University years.

New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/4re4rh/should_i_leave_New York University/,"New York University isn't for everybody. but freshman year can be a tough adjustment at any university. you have a bunch of kids--many who have never been far from the embrace of home--and now they're on their own. some kids act like they've never lived in civilized society before. some are incapable of living without mom and dad cleaning up their messes or structuring their homework time. entering any new world is going to be a culture shock, especially at age 18-19. 

in my experience, sophomore year tends to be a lot different. with a year of perspective, some people realize that when they retell the story about their shitty roommate... they were the one who was actually a shitty roommate. new social groups form once removed from the animal house of freshman housing. instead of intro classes taught by adjuncts or grad students, you'll start to have access to classes with more established, respected professors. 

a lot of what you're upset about could happen at absolutely any college. if suggest evaluating why you came here and whether or not those opportunities are as real as you thought they were. you shouldn't choose a college for a social scene but for what it can do for your future career. to some extent, that means the connections you can make and the internships you have access to. but it also has to do with how the university supports those in your major. i don't know what career you have in mind, but if nyc is where the nexus of that career is, then you'll want to stay close to it.

#New York University issue: classes

it's unfortunate you didn't have a good experience academically/intellectually your first year. i don't know if that's because all your professors sucked (it sounds like a few did) or because you were enrolled in required classes that didn't engage your interest, or a combination of both. 

i do know that one of my favorite professors ever, [prof. michael shenefelt](http://www.liberalstudies.New York University.edu/object/io_1292612046674.html), is a professor in liberal studies. i took foundations of philosophical thought with him one summer and fell in love with the subject. this is anecdotal, but my point is that there are good professors in lsp, as there are in every New York University school, and maybe you just haven't found them yet.

#personal issues: culture, dorming, friends:

i flagged these as ""personal"" because: (1) the only way to make friends is to put yourself out there; (2) there is plenty of community at New York University, it just might not be the ""rah rah, go, fight, win!"" school spirit you see at other universities (greek life is perhaps the best option for people looking for tight knit social networks); (3) you need to stand up for yourself.

your roommates sound like dicks, but there's a big gap between ""being determined to respect my roommates"" and allowing them to walk all over you (cleaning up their mess, allowing them to use and disrespect your property). you said you feel judged/uncomfortable going down to do the laundry... this is a signal that your insecurities are getting the best of you (it's not a problem with New York University, it's a personal issue you need to work on).

you're young, you've still got a lot to learn about the world and yourself. it's unfortunate you didn't have a great time with your classes, but i honestly think you could get a lot more out of New York University socially/culturally if you become a bit more assertive about your wants, boundaries, and expectations.

i was more introverted coming in and for me it forced me to get out there.

there s ways to avoid being trapped and lonely in a non traditional campus and doing so is no different than what you would do at a traditional one, so might as well benefit from the location.

first off definitely go to the club fair and sign up for everything you re interested in or would want to explore. that ll get you a start to meeting people, and you can branch out from there. 

it s your time to explore and what better place to do it than the city? the upside of the city is that the subway is easy to get around, and apartment parties means you can wander home drunk and be fine, rather than risking dui or needing a dd in almost any other college campus. 

now, i know the stores, bars, and food (the one star michelin s are divine - dm me for a list if you want), and eventually after much exploring found multiple groups that fit me - some didn t work out and that s fine bc that s how the city is-diverse, complex, and full of opinions that you have to find your niche in that you enjoy.

New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/gezcxn/depressed_about_New York University/,"this is a question that is often asked, and one that i have always given a great deal of thought in answering. the short answer, New York University requires a unique personality in order to really thrive in the environment. i also think it is very much a ""what you put in is what you get out"" type of situation.

if you are 100% introverted, your experience will be really mixed. the lack of a main campus allows you to be very independent. it allows you to fly under the radar and not feel pressured to take part in the traditional college experience. on the other hand, being purely introverted can also make it feel like a very lonely place because no one will hold your hand or encourage you into doing stuff outside of your usual self. this can have a depressing impact on some.

if you are 100% extroverted, the experience will also be really mixed. the fact that you are in a competitive environment and one of the largest cities in the world can drain you really quickly if you have to constantly be putting yourself out there. this can lead to that depressed state. the flip side to this is that being very outgoing can make any experience (at New York University or otherwise) a fun social experience due to the vast amounts of events in the city.

my personal take on it is that you really require parts of both introversion and extroversion to really thrive. the nontraditional campus requires that you are capable of doing things alone, being able to care for yourself and not have the constant need of others to function. the reason is that everyone in nyc is usually busy doing their own thing. between school, jobs, events, etc. you can't expect to have a friend or two by your side 10-15 hours of the day that you would otherwise have in a closed campus setting. this is why being able to take charge of your own being, recharge in your alone time, etc. is important. likewise, you need a certain level of extroversion. being in nyc you will engage with the outside world. nyc is essentially your campus/playground. you can keep to yourself, but you will have to engage with others at some point to get things done. introverts are not the same as antisocial individuals, but sometimes they appear that way if they need downtime at what others perceive is the ""wrong time"" (i.e., in the middle of a networking event, a large class, etc.) you need a certain level of risk taking to break that comfort zone on demand and/or when needed.

ultimately, you must ask yourself what kind of person you really are. you have to be very honest with yourself as to how you really really are, and not necessarily what you imagine or would like yourself to be. if you honestly believe that you need to be in a closed campus setting or the center of attention at all times, New York University will likely make you feel miserable or disappointed. if you are truly an introvert, not antisocial, but maybe a little shy and willing to take some risks/step out of your comfort zone...you may be very happy at New York University. if you are a complete introvert, but also shy and have never been able to take a risk and start conversations or make friends...attending New York University will not automatically make you less shy or happy. you will feel more miserable because making friends requires an extra step and it is very easy to fall into a self defeating mentality if you don't make friends at first. this goes back to the reason why i mentioned needing a balanced personality.

personally, i loved my time at New York University and have no regrets about my experience. nyc forces you to become much more independent. i am an introvert, but i felt comfortable enough to get out of my comfort zone at times. i liked the ability to retreat when i felt i needed to recharge or focus on me, but that i could take the risk and put myself out there when i was ready. this mix allowed me to build close friendships that i wanted to build/maintain. it also allowed me to explore the extrovert side of me. sometimes it was exhausting, but it allowed me to practice and not feel like i could never be an extrovert.",Comment,Neutral
New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/gezcxn/depressed_about_New York University/,"i ve posted about it a few times in the past few weeks when people ask about their experience at New York University, but i ll keep it short. if you stop looking for a traditional college experience and just embrace the city for what it is, you can have an amazing time. it s not for everyone, but for me personally, this past year has created some of the best experiences i ve had in ages. all of my friends love it here so far too. freshman year can be amazing if you make an active effort to socialize. this effort will most likely be more than you ve made in the past. but once you find a solid group of people (and there s plenty of them), you ll have plenty of amazing things to do in the city with them. nyc is many things, but boring is not one of them.",Comment,Neutral

New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/gezcxn/depressed_about_New York University/,"it really depends. 

my first semester sucked. i was so stressed and homesick and sad because i was lonely. and because i was sad i didn t have any energy to go out and become not lonely. so it was a bad spiral. that said, i was also taking really hard classes and so i didn t have whole lot of time/energy to get to know others. my roommates were pretty outgoing and i m more introverted and not a party-goer so i didn t hang out with them either. 

but! 

i will say that there are a lot of opportunities for connections. there are lots of events going on, like if you live on campus there will definitely be free events (museum trips, movie nights, gelato and coffee hangouts). depending on which school you go to, there might be additional support groups. cas has the cohort program which can be helpful in connecting with people (also sponsor a lot of events). and then there are so many clubs... and you re in nyc so if you have some money there s a lot you can do (eat out at new and interesting places in chinatown or little italy; a lot of museums are discounted/free for college students) in manhattan or elsewhere in the city. of course all of that hinges on having the energy/time to put yourself out there.

New York University, on the other hand, never sleeps. and it s not because students are always active, it s because washington square park, the center of the campus, is so incredibly lively. i ve seen bands playing xylophones and tubas after a storm, i ve walked through the halloween day parade, i ve seen dogs skateboarding around the fountain, i ve seen wise men write poems about couples within a minute for free. New York University campus is ridiculously underrated, and everyone who visits will tell you that having a closed off campus is nowhere near as fun or uplifting as having a campus so full of life and genuine new york pride. keep in mind, i ve lived in the city my whole life, and New York University campus is by far my favorite place to me at.",Comment,Neutral
New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/gezcxn/depressed_about_New York University/,"as someone who is social but has panic issues, New York University helped with breaking the ice for friend groups (cohorts, major-only tours, welcome week events, club fair) which introduced me to the opportunities of New York University and the city. first semester is bumpy, but if you join clubs, sports, greek life, or even a local comedy club you ll develop friends over time.

the city is huge for sure, but you don t have to explore it all the time. freshman dorms are within the greenwich village area, which makes it easier to get more comfortable with your surroundings and meet up with others. plus you ll likely have to take writing the essay (unless you re in ls from what i understand), which is something that you and your classmates are going to have to suffer together. second semester is when it becomes a bit easier to make friendships because of the required plenaries that you have with other classes.

i personally don t experience the non-campus aspect of New York University as often as others because most of my classes are at metrotech, which is just the jay st buildings for tisch and tandon. on top of that you ll have buildings where most of your classes take place, so you ll see familiar faces around.

if you re really concerned about friendships and preventing feelings of isolation, i d recommend utilizing instagram and the New York University2024 hashtag to find potential friends and make plans for when you re actually at New York University. it helped me a lot and when i saw people from instagram in person it was a great conversation starter.

cuny brooklyn for my field at the time is very reputable, though. not as good a ranking as New York University, but not too far behind and it's 1/3 as cheap. i was really happy with that program.

for my second masters (in a different field), i interviewed admins and teachers at Columbia University, New York University, and cuny. i asked them about their research, their interests, how they could support me, etc. and from these interviews, New York University stood had and shoulders above the rest so.i chose them.

New York University,https://www.reddit.com/r/New York University/comments/k90h5t/cas_cs_is_going_from_bad_to_worse/,"i've probably spent the most time of any student thinking, writing and meeting with people to improve New York University cs. i'll give this advice:

- it's pretty likely you'll get no response from marsha or denis. marsha responded to my emails before, but she stopped responding somewhat recently. granted i haven't pushed my emails that hard. denis will just not respond. you'd have better luck talking to his assistant, stephanie tracy.

- even if you get in contact, the default response is to throw their hands up in the air and claim nothing can be done. i swear New York University's favorite phrase is ""we can't"".

- cs doesn't get funds from cas. well at least, not directly. courant is its own weird entity. it's also unlikely that research funds are competing with funding for teaching. if anything they need more research funding so they can hire more professors to teach the cs classes.

- hiring is really really hard in cs. you can't just hire more professors. there's only so many people who are qualified professor candidates and a lot of schools/companies competing for them. without more professors, it's pretty hard to teach classes. unlike other fields there isn't a pool of adjuncts willing to teach for 30k a year.

- if we can't solve hiring, how do we fix the problem? i actually *just* write a blog post about [this](https://blog.torchNew York University.com/2020/12/08/waitlisted-professor-allocation.html). basically, we need to allocate professors better by having bigger sections and use more *undergraduate* tas.

- recruiting totally sucks here. agreed. unfortunately how many people in the cs department have actually worked as a programmer and understand recruiting? almost none. it's a problem.

- recruiting is actually a sign of a bigger issue. New York University's cs department is more like an applied math/numerical computing department with a few begrudgingly hired cs professors. there's a distinct lack of people who actually code and actually understand machine architecture. which is totally fine at the research level, but makes it hard to field out competent professors for undergraduate classes. this is due to courant primarily being a *math* institute. cs has always played second fiddle.

- these issues are really hard to solve because no long term person gives a shit. professors at courant are in an odd situation where the prestige of the school as a research institution significantly outmatches its prestige as an undergraduate program. richard courant literally carved out a top notch research institution in a sub-par school. back in the day, New York University was primarily a commuter school that everybody thought was a public school. the students weren't amazing back then. professors developed almost as a survival skill a practice of lackadaisical teaching and ignorance towards student affairs. this has carried on to this day, even though the quality of students has certainly risen.

- you can see this lack of attention towards students in how they grade. courant doesn't really care about students getting a good education, so they'll happily pass students through. want straight as? take all advanced special topics classes in the math department! they literally have zero work. you can get an a without understanding anything. or look at how inconsistent the classes are. if you take cso with jinyang, you'll get an extremely different class than if you took it with goldberg.

again, i've probably tried the most of anybody i know to drag New York University cs out of the gutter. i've written endless posts on how to be a better cs student. i've talked with administrators and professors. i've run mentorship programs, organized a slack, tutored people for free, etc. but i'm only here for so long. if you want actual, systemic change, you need a permanent person with actual political power (i.e. a tenured professor) to take the reins. i'm not sure that will happen any time soon.",Comment,Neutral

op sounds like a generally more outgoing person, and for those types the lounges seemed great. for people less comfortable with just walking up to a stranger in the lounge and talking, they aren't nearly as helpful. if you are in the latter camp, i'd recommend going for a 4-person housing assignment. i got stuck with just one roommate that spoke to me less than a dozen times for my whole freshman year, and it was not a good experience in the slightest.

i had multiple roommates my sophomore year, and had a much better time because of that. no roommate situation is perfect, but your odds of living with someone you might be friends with are much higher with multiple roommates (bed-for-bed is also an option with doubles, but that's also not something everyone is comfortable with requesting).

> the quality of professors are 6/10. many of the old poly professors are quite old and from my experience, are not good at all.

this differs wildly by department, but overall the quality of the faculty at tandon is top notch. however, the general engineering programs that freshmen and sophmore are subjected to are quite bad, because no talented faculty want to teach them and they're staffed by random adjuncts the school picks up from surrounding programs (suny/cuny).

> with that said, the workload at tandon is very hard. you will be very stressed out even if you got the best scores in your entire graduating class. maybe, your freshman year will be easy but not afterwards. expect to put in about 30-50 hours a week studying for your entire four years. everyone else around you will also be doing exactly the same so you will not feel any fomo.

tandon is really very easy by engineering standards, without any particularly heavy requirements for math or science. you can see this reflected in the school's retention and graduation rates, which are much higher than ""weed out"" schools with truly grueling programs.

> your freshman year, you will probably do eg-1003. i think they put that class there so you get your ass beat in your freshman year and then you can rethink whether you wanna do engineering at all.

1003 is a trivial course. i really have no idea what this comment is about. your hardest test will be staying awake and trying to find enough bullshit to fill the lab reports.

1001 is a course where local crazy person david leffer sells snake-oil to unsuspecting students. i am honestly blown away anyone thinks this course is good or valuable.

i am an international student and had already comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted to another school by the time the acceptance came out and i knew i would regret it if i didn't accept, so i withdrew and came here instead.

i came to Columbia University with plenty of fears that i will be competing with literally the best minds from around the world. i was also worried that i would fail the standards of the brilliant professors here. yet the fear meant nothing. i was so happy to get a chance to come here. i really did. i was virile enough to convince myself that my best efforts could yield good results.

the only thing that was on my list of plans when i came here was gpa, gpa, gpa. i wanted what i had achieved before what i had in little college experience i had prior to Columbia University. for the last two years i've been here i've been getting good grades but becoming bedridden and health issues from burnouts have been escalating.

online classes especially has been hell on earth for international students like myself. i am surprised at how much they neglected us for the sake of academic honesty. i would never do anything close to what they are trying to protect against. yet i've been met with brick walls from professors, unreliable administrative procedures, etc. so called avoiding unfair circumstances for students in terms of test taking times (office hours nothing you can do) is ironic. i've had to take my midterms at 2-3am. the entire semester my night and day has been flipped. i've pass failed easy classes because of dumb mistakes i made in such tests i normally would never make.

today i am taking two finals back to back from 9pm to 7am with 2 hours break in between which i am not sleeping on because i am afraid i will not wake up. my drive to maintain my composure and effort is gone, my grades are naturally not as stellar, and i'm really sad my experience here at this beautiful school has to be this way.

lately i've been able to feel nothing but the duties of school. my life has been numbers, tests, and work. and i'm only now trying to redefine what it means to be a college student, what it means to be a Columbia Universityn, because if i don't.. i'll leave here with only grim memories and screen fatigue.

finance hiring mostly comes down to networking, they re not really scrutinizing your cv in the way an admissions comMassachusetts Institute of Technologytee does, and gs has access to the same networking resources as everyone else. the  we only hire from certain schools  thing is usually shorthand for  we only do networking and on-campus recruiting events at certain schools.  the social life is as good or as bad as you make it, but at the beginning you re probably gonna have to be the one to take initiative and be as outgoing as you re comfortable being.

people from all colleges get along really well and no one cares what college you re in. the biggest  rift,  if you could even call it that, might be that some gs students coming from the military or community college get a bit of culture shock from the privileged backgrounds and academic intensity of many cc/seas students, but if you re coming from berkeley then you re probably already used to a culture of type-a, highly-driven students. it s worth noting that quite a few cc/seas students who don t come from prep schools and/or wealthy backgrounds experience a similar culture shock. one other big difference is that gs people don t live in cc/seas dorms but that s mostly because your average gs student in their 20s or 30s is not gonna want to room with some 19-year-old who s never lived away from home before.",Comment,Neutral

to any of your questions that aim at generalizations, like how people get along, etc, there is simply no answer. Columbia University as a whole is just such an individualized experience there is literally no way to pattern how it works. if you get along with people, you will be able to make friends across all 4 colleges if you want to. 

the best way to understand Columbia University is that there are two types of people 1) those that succeed and make the most of Columbia University 2) those that don't. both of these categories of people exists across all four undergraduate schools. once you're here, you are on equal footing and all that matters is what you do next. sure, maybe the percentage of 'succesful' students are higher in cc because it is far more selective, but that statistics has no bearing on your individual ability to succeed--that is up to you. Columbia University and beyond is a rat race, there are going to be losers and winners and whether you're cc or gs doesn't automatically determine which category you're going to fall into. anyone who buys into identity categorizations are idiots. i have been chosen for so many positions and opportunities at the school over cc people, it really just comes down to who is a better Columbia University student and that is independent from the route you took to get here which is the primary difference between all the schools.

2. i think there is some social separation between gs and cc/seas, in part because the gs crowd is much older, i was in my mid 20s as a first year gs student and didn't really have much of an interest in hanging out with the cc freshman in my classes. if you are closer in age i think there will be a lot less of a barrier. the gs students all have orientation together which is a great time to meet people.

overall, i would still strongly consider staying at berkeley. the core requirements here rarely accept transfer credit so you may be causing yourself an extra year of study by transferring. there is also a cap on credit you can put towards the major, which could be another pain point.",Comment,Neutral

Columbia University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia University/comments/awtyoe/how_socially_active_is_Columbia University/,"this is a great question! i don't know why people are down-voting you.

this will very much depend on three factors: (1) major, (2) finances, and (3) desired gpa.

(1) if your major is a toughie (tough majors at Columbia University: pre-med, math, stats, neuro, cs, engineering, physics, chem/bio... am i missing anything? rip anyone who says econ) your social life will suffer.

(2) if you have to work part-time to pay for school, your social life will suffer. if you don't have a lot of money to spend on bar-hopping, there is still stuff to do here, but since bar-hopping is a huge social Columbia University past-time and can be pricey, your social life will suffer (less opportunity for fun).

(3) desired gpa: naturally, you'll have a better social life the lower your desired gpa is and the easier that gpa is to attain within your major.

i hope this helps a little bit.

for a more generic answer, the social scene here (like all of new york) is there for those who will reach for it. unlike big state universities, there is no ""hype club"" that puts big fun social activities on your doorstep. this school very much feels like an extension of a hyper-elite high school: most of the kids here come here to work their asses off then get a job. the sweetest experiences here will be your intellectual growth more than your crazy parties and midnight adventures (which still exist).

however, if you are focused, use your study time wisely, you can socialize to the extent you want and be successful at premed here. students who make it through premed here typically do great on the mcat. moreover, if you are a top student at Columbia University (or frankly, even a bit less than top but compelling cv), you will get interviews from top medical schools. there are a ton of opportunities here, but it's easy to get so beaten down that you lose sight of the bigger picture.

Columbia University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia University/comments/umu5ye/how_has_the_Columbia University_brand_name_opened_doors_for/,"most extreme example i can remember: sophomore year (undergrad), i went to indianapolis for a huge 3-day engineering conference. i was interested in aerospace and boeing was doing on-the-spot interviews in a large recruitment suite. the line for this suite wrapped around the hallway and was at a complete halt. some rep outside, who was screening resumes, took one look at mine and immediately ushered me ahead of \~30 people to the suite. ngl, it felt *very* weird. at the time, i didn't have much experience and i could tell he made the decision based on the college name alone. when i entered the suite, suspicions confirmed, it was basically a bunch of my Columbia University peers (that i travelled with) and some Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University undergrads. in the end, i didn't get an offer, because i had very little relevant coursework and experience as a sophomore.

that experience was an outlier, though. usually, an interviewer might make a remark about Columbia University, ask me about sports/academics/memories for light banter, and the interview continues as normal. whether it opens doors or not, you still have to be qualified and do the work.

the prestige aspect is overstated. experience and skill ultimately matter over rank (at least outside of ib, s&t, quant, etc). i would take the opportunity to work with terence tao in a heartbeat over any marginal name brand advantage. none of the schools you mentioned have trouble getting their grads into the best tech/engineering companies anyway.",Comment,Neutral

Columbia University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia University/comments/umu5ye/how_has_the_Columbia University_brand_name_opened_doors_for/,"hmm, this is an interesting question that is hard to answer because it depends on a lot of factors.

i will say that if ib, pe, or vc work appeals to you, the ivy league (or ivy league-esque schools like Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University ) is definitely where you should be to have a better chance getting a job in those areas. it also helps to be in nyc, but that is not absolutely necessary. other top schools (University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon University, ga tech, etc..) do produce grads that go and work at these companies, but i think these ib/pe/vc firms specifically target ivy league schools and primarily recruit from them. i still feel like the only reason i scored an ib internship is because i go to an ivy league school. that alone is not a good reason to hire someone, but it's basically exactly what happens. that said, the Columbia University name will help you get the finance interviews, but you need to be prepared for said interviews in order to get the internship. (btw, i strongly disliked ib and i'm never going back.)

aside from ib, i think the name has helped me *get* interviews--the job/intern applicant screening process involves a lot of glances at resum s, and school name is one thing that can be used as a cut-off. however, after getting the interview invites, i've needed to actually show that i have the social and technical skills that the employer is looking for in order to get the internship or job. for example, my first few interviews for tech companies back when i was a freshman could not have been worse. i'm still embarrassed by those. the social part was fine, i got along with everyone, but i went in with no practice solving leetcode medium or hard problems and i had no idea that i actually needed to prepare for the interview. after a few bad inteviews with no follow-up, i started grinding leetcode and my subsequent ones went well and i got a few internship offers. in sum, having the Columbia University name on my resume may have helped catch a recruiter's eye, but my lack of ability to successfully demonstrate that i had relevant skills made me an immediate reject. don't rely on the name to get you the job--it doesn't work like that.

there was at least one interviewer for each of my internship applications who would make some remark on my academics and the rigor of the institution, but i was asked a lot more about my technical skills and i think the principle decider was the coding interviews for tech and the valuation/finance questions for ib, both of which require prior knowledge and preparation. 

i will say that my internships at big tech and small tech companies had interns from lots of non-ivy schools who were clearly better coders and software engineers than i was. i don't think tech companies liMassachusetts Institute of Technology themselves to recruiting at the ivy league nearly as much as high finance does because i think they realize that good cs students are at schools other than ivies. most of my cohorts were non ivy league students. i don't think people who want to work in tech need to come from the ivy league and i don't know if the Columbia University brand helps at all given that it's a pretty even playing field b/c recruiting happens on many campuses. also, the demand for workers is too high for them to only rely on ivy grads. i was *blown away* by two university of rochester students and one swarthmore student i interned with. i mean, they could code so well and had taken many more classes that encouraged projects and collaborative group work that mimicked the environments we found ourselves in. i was like wtf Columbia University, you need to step it up a notch. this was humbling and also taught me that prestige is stupid af.

prestige has nothing to do with the quality of the learning or the intelligence of the students at the school. once you realize this, the whole ""oooh, ivy league"" glamour goes away quickly. maybe the average person who hears that you go to Columbia University might be impressed, but, in reality it says very little about you other than some dean was impressed by some test scores and what you looked like on paper.

side note: don't pay too close attention to the school rankings in those published lists. the top 100-ish schools don't really differ from each other that substantially. anyone who says anything different is definitely selling something. also, i'm american and i have 100% heard of eth zurich (epfl is also another highly regarded swiss school.) every western country has their ivy equivalent. uk - oxbridge, german - tum and lmu, france - all the grandes  coles (but especially ens, polytechnique, science po), etc.. some people may or may not be familiar with them. lots of people outside the us don't know a lot about ivy league schools except Yale University and Harvard University. i'd wager many don't know about dartmouth, Cornell University, Columbia University, etc.. all of these countries have top schools that have their own in-country value whether we know their names or not.

Columbia University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia University/comments/67cc39/how_cutthroat_is_Columbia University_really/,"op didn't specify, so i'm going to assume you're asking about undergrad. i should preface this by saying that i'm a transfer student at gs (came here from another ivy after taking a few years off from school), so take into account that my own prior experiences/perspective are very atypical.

 cutthroat and cliquey  are a little extreme, but it's not too far off the mark. the campus culture is very school-oriented - i d agree with what someone else said about cu s academic difficulty as defining your time here. making friends isn t that hard, but actually making the time to see each other is. the combination of super urban location/super heavy schoolwork mean that you really have to make a strong effort to actually hang out with your friends at Columbia University (this is probably slightly better if you live in a dorm, which i never did.) there were plenty of douchebags i couldn t be bothered with, but it was also super hard to find time to hang out with all the cool people i did meet here because everyone is so busy and overworked. at some point, even chillest, nicest people will end up being selfish with their time here.
 
for someone choosing between schools with comparable academic reputations, you should really only come to Columbia University if:

1) the prestige is worth the $250k+ price tag
2) academics are the most important factor and you re totally fine with skipping out on the  traditional  undergrad experience you d have at most us schools 
3) you have to attend your school in ny because of professional or family reasons

the last reason mostly applies to gs students, so assuming you re choosing between cc/seas/barnard, choose carefully. school spirit is low, there s not much of a sense of community, people are usually stressed and never shut up about school, on-campus outlets for fun/socializing are weak (greek life here is a joke) and nobody cares about Columbia University sports, at all. (i honestly feel super bad for the athletes here, but that s another topic.) 

as a point of comparison, i went to dartmouth for 3 years before transferring to Columbia University (probably the two most different schools imaginable.) the academics are about equally challenging in terms of difficulty, but there are big tradeoffs. compared to dartmouth, Columbia University assigns way more tests/schoolwork, requires much more time spent in class, and has much larger class sizes (way more tas, fewer opportunities for 1-on-1 interaction with profs.) two of the biggest drawbacks to coming here are the lack of physical space and the sheer amount of time you actually have to spend on schoolwork. the latter can really liMassachusetts Institute of Technology you from fully exploring the city, hanging out with friends, reading/learning for leisure, or doing a lot of the things that define  college"" in most people s minds - you just have too much damn work. there s some cool student groups, but any group that is actually large/well-funded enough to actually do anything usually ends up with people competing over meaningless leadership roles to pad their resumes (assistant vp of communications for a 10-person organization, or something like that.)

i did a summer program in hs at brown but can t really speak to it otherwise, i do know that the alums have a reputation for being super enthusiastic about the school (much like dartmouth alums.) Columbia University is something like #34 in alumni giving rate among us universities, which tells you something about how much most cu alums enjoyed spending undergrad here.

tl; dr: Columbia University has amazing academic opportunities, but it s really stressful and requires an absurd amount of time spent on schoolwork, being located in manhattan has a lot of inherent compromises, and the administration gives 0 shits about the undergrad experience. if you want to balance academics with a fun undergrad experience, go to brown instead.

Columbia University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia University/comments/67cc39/how_cutthroat_is_Columbia University_really/,"Columbia University isn't a cut throat place, by and large (though presumably this could vary by major/department? i can say that i never encountered any of that). it does, however, treat you like an adult, which can be really startling for someone who isn't prepared for it. 

what do i mean by that exactly? no one is going to hold your hand. you're going to be expected to make friends with people, do your coursework, and find ways to entertain yourself on your own. it isn't the kind of school where everyone goes to the big game every weekend to get trashed on light beer. if that is the college experience you are looking for, look elsewhere. Columbia University actually believes in diversity in the sense of pluralism, rather than diversity in the sense of people who look different but all do the same stuff. 

yes, Columbia University is ""cliquey"" in the sense that you actually have to put in effort to meet friends and make plans. you live in nyc. people aren't going to just go strike up conversations with everyone they see walking around. if you want to be friends with people, you have to actually have something in common with them and also make an effort to hang out. if you are shy or not used to meeting a lot of new people this can be stressful and take a while, and before you sort of ""find your niche"" it can feel like there is no community etc. but there are a lot of things to do, all the time, which cater to every possible interest, both on campus and off. if you don't have the initiative to make plans with people to do things of mutual interest, you are going to be sad and lonely when everyone else is doing fun things all over nyc and you're sitting on campus alone with the people who never leave the library. 

in response to the links you posted: that was just not my experience at all. yeah, you have to do your fucking work, but it isn't that hard and it doesn't take that much of your time. as evidence of this, i present the fact that every single one of those people complaining about how much stress they are under took the time to write a magazine piece or reddit thread bitching about how little time they have! one wonders how, if everyone is so stressed out about classes, they have so much free time for extracurricular writing and dicking around on the internet... to the ""everyone goes into finance"" thing, there is an easy solution: don't go into finance if you don't want to. it's a pretty ridiculous attitude that people who work for goldman are ""selling out""; you have no idea why they are choosing to work where they work, or what they see their future career path to be, and it is an act of stunning hubris to assume that everyone has to share your sense of what is or is not an appropriate or desirable career choice.

i don t think one is strictly more rigorous either. rigor will be more on department and class selection specific.

but applying to transfer schools takes some work. so the fact that you bothered to do all that work, makes me think some part of you really wants the experience   and that ultimately you d regret it if you didn t or wonder what if

i think in life it s better to not wonder what if. worst worst case scenario is you come here and you hate it for 2 years, but you learn a hell of a lot about what you like about University of California Los Angeles vs Columbia University. which is some really good insight to learn sooner rather than later. it will also teach you about where you want to live and what kind of job you might like. you will also get some connections on both coasts

doesn't help when there is no sort of standard in the course material in classes taught by different professors. a friend of mine (who is way smarter than i am, by the way) just got a b+ in discrete math w/ dear. i looked at some of their homeworks and assignments and exams, and to be honest the discrete math class i took feels like child's play in comparison. if they were in ansaf's class, they'd definitely get an a at least, if not an a+. just weird that it's like this.

also, i feel like i came here to learn. now i also don't learn anything in easy classes, so i tend to take harder classes a lot. the side benefit of doing this is that people in these classes are usually smarter than most, and i like meeting smart people. but then my gpa falls when i take these classes, and (at least for my aspirations) my gpa matters quite a lot. so i also sometimes feel like while the people with ridiculously high gpas are definitely smart and hardworking, there's an element of luck with classes and exams and all of that in there.

Columbia University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia University/comments/rqrgor/how_stressful_is_Columbia University/,"the stress culture at Columbia University is alive and well. 

students here are very competitive and Columbia University has a strong culture of individualism. it is also difficult to get as in general because the bar for excellence is high. this means people feel more ""against"" their classmates than ""collaborative with"" their classmates. i'd say this individualistic and competitive culture also leads a lot of students to feel alone and to rely on self-motivation and studying by themselves to succeed. feeling alone + making it difficult to get as, voila, you have the recipe for stress.

that said, it is possible to thrive here. i like it here a lot. i feel challenged to do my best and i am happy that the professors expect a lot from me. it's motivating. i also enjoy solitude--i am social and have great friends, but i do spend a lot of my time by myself (mostly studying in the library, but also at the gym or just relaxing for an hour or so) and i'm happy doing so. 

however, i always find the beginning of each semester to be daunting and i usually feel down. the new material seems overwhelming and it just feels impossibly hard. i usually get over that in a few weeks by doing the work, practicing, and getting better at mastering the material and then it's truly enjoyable. i know i have to put in a lot of effort and time to do well and i know i need to be in my best mental and physical health to do so. i think a lot of students suffer because one or the other (physical or mental health) are easy to neglect in college when you have so much other stuff (mostly studying) going on.

1. first guy is 100% right. the moment that you are having thoughts of inadequacy, you need to take a break, go for a walk, get something to eat or go to your dorm and take a break.
2. don't compare yourself to others, especially those outside of your program or your field. we are all intelligent in our own unique ways. and there is a big difference between the skill sets needed to get an a in a major like business versus an a in philosophy. know that you are enough. you got into cc, and that alone proves you belong here. everyone has a starting point, even if you haven't mastered the knowledge placed before you.
3. talk with your professors. email them. go to their office hours. get to know them both as professionals and individuals. ask them questions about the demands of your major,  how you should be organizing study time, what career opportunities you'll have, etc.. don't be afraid to ask where you could be doing better. and there is no shame in talking about the possibility of switching majors too if you are unhappy.
4. talk with older students within your program or major. partner with them, study with them.
5. use the writing center if you need help with papers.
6. grades, gpas are not the greatest predictors for career or lifetime ""success."" and the word, ""success"" is also highly subjective. i know a brilliant guy who is a phd candidate, has a teaching job at another ivy. brilliant scholar, but totally inept at everything else; friendships, relationships, emotions, basic interactions, etc. we went on a date once, and he confided in me that he watched reruns of arthur after school until he was like a senior in high school. now, arthur is a good show, but a well rounded person would probably do something cooler, like skateboarding or learning how to make a quiche. not this guy. fucking arthur, francine, binky, buster (best character ever), dw and the goddamn dog, pal. after school. every. single. fucking. day. should have been a big red flag. pretty sure he also continued that routine into college too. said guy likely has a perfect gpa, but there's no hope for him being that weird, cool, interesting or funny academic who students love to talk about and admire, like foucault or baudrillard. if our very small field had to eulogize him today, we'll remember him as a simple pedagogue, a teacher, but nothing really beyond that. no cool stories of partying, hijinks, joking around, good conversations, or overt sexual fetishes that show up in your writings. just that he liked books. and arthur. words of wisdom: don't be arthur guy.

also, if you like philosophy, you might actually hate a philosophy major. i nearly finished a minor in philosophy the study of philosophy in the department takes a very dry approach to fun and interesting ideas. the philosophy you read in the core is way better than the philosophy classes offered from the department, because classes are small, the tone is conversational, and people bring a much more varied perspective. 

if you find yourself stuck in a grind in butler and unable to enjoy yourself, take classes that seem more fun to you. take classes with less of a workload (i.e. find some easy a s there s no shame in it.)take a pe class. take things you might want to try, and do it pass/fail if you re worried about the grades (i did ear training it was a blast and i learned a lot about music).

parking near campus is hard and i highly encourage finding a place at walking distance from campus. so you're going to be using the subway a lot. it takes a little time to adjust to the fact that you can't just drive out anytime or just stuff your trunk with groceries. you have to carry everything home yourself, so more frequent and smaller trips might be necessary. many apartments do not have a washer dryer, so you might have to use laundromats weekly. that can be a pain. some apartments are walk ups; that can get annoying, especially when moving furniture.

you will be more cognizant of safety since you're going to be walking around everywhere and using the metro. you will encounter crazy frequently. crazy might come sit right next to you on the subway. but it's not really a problem if you're self-aware and have some street sense. you just ignore and walk away.


people in general rave about nyc culture. you'll find a group for everything under the sun. from larp to tech/fashion/art niches to crochet  . there are a lot of events regularly for both entertainment and learning. if you have any hobby, it's easy to find a community.

if there's something you're worried about in specific, feel free to highlight that. a lot depends on your standard of living, income and savings. it's insanely easy to blow through 50k of savings in a year if you're not careful. then again, there are students living happily on approx 20k annual. prices will be similar to sf for the most part.

Columbia University,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbia University/comments/tvqurz/is_the_stress_culture_real_masters_students/,"depressing weather: it ll be the same for New York University, worse for Cornell University. 

lack of community: i have New York University friends and it seems that New York University is even more fragmented than Columbia University - we have a campus so there s some sense there, but New York University s city integrated campus is not exactly ideal for community building. Cornell University friends have told me that the only reason they have school spirit is because there s literally nothing else to do or focus on outside of school. take from that what you will. 

rigorous work load: can t speak for other universities, but Columbia University s workload has been as expected for me. it s a good university, there s going to be high achieving students, that s inevitable. i can t lie, you re probably going to become depressed, but at this point what college student isn t? (especially since your other choices are also rigorous unis) 

if your choices are between New York University and Cornell University i would 100% choose Columbia University. at least you get a nice campus and so much city life perks. can t speak for hopkins though, not too well researched on them.

that ll be true at New York University and Cornell University as well (probably much more so at Cornell University) if this matters to you, choose hopkins. also why did you apply exclusively to schools in the northeast if that s a concern?

also, as some of the other posts have pointed out - the weather can get depressing after the summer. do make it a point to attend as many social events as you can when you first get here (which is also when your coursework would be a little bit lighter) and make good friends there. having friends whom you can count on def helps when the going gets tough.

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a great school with a great rep. i'm one of the top commenters on the ""don't know how to pronounce it"" thread. my grandparents *know* University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is one of the top public universities in the country, they're just a little up in years and from a different country, so saying such a long name isn't as easy for them as it might be for an american. a u of i degree is well-respected and well ranked. no, we aren't an ivy, but we're a top-tier public school with great prospects. i went to an out-of-state highly competitive high school and people were busting their asses and ed'ing to get here, one of the smartest people i know in my hometown didn't get in! University of California Los Angeles is also not a party school, it is a highly competitive also top-ranked public university on par with us, so you can stick your ivy-elitism where the sun doesn't shine.

engineering might be different, but i've had a great time with most of my classes, professors, gen eds, and schedules. yeah, some shit sucks- i shouldn't have to do two qr classes as an english/psych major imo and i had a rough time in atms 120 to the point where i dropped it. every school has a few shitty classes and profs, it's just how life works. i'm doing two majors and a minor though and if i get what i need, i'm on track to easily graduate in 3.5 years. it's not easy to schedule when english classes have one section of a class that seniors fill faster than fast sometimes, but i think i've got a way better experience of it here than i would at most schools. but hey. i'm probably in an ""easy major"" to you (which is a whole separate issue because objectively, no major is 'easy' and stem elitism is shitty but i digress), so let me try and make this more applicable. literally almost all my friends are engineers, they're all on track to graduate in four years without going mad most semesters thanks to good advising, they go pretty hard at parties on the weekends, and they're part of a lot of rsos- many are in sororities and frats which, being a sorority member, i'd argue is pretty darn time consuming. obviously, everyone has a different experience, but being socially active and being in engineering aren't mutually exclusive.

speaking of, yeah this is kinda a party school, but it is not liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed to partying. i don't party much despite being in an 'easy major', i go out and get wild maybe once a month max. i won't be nineteen for a hot minute so i don't go to bars either. but honestly, i love champaign-urbana more than i love my big-city hometown. i love walking around campus and discovering new places i don't go much. i love taking a random bus all the way to the edges of town just to see what's out there. i love walking down green with my friends just to go to county market or tour a random apartment for fun. i love spending time in any library there is here and just poring over books. i love going down to ragstock to hang out. i love our stupid little cornfield and i love my rsos- and side note, they aren't all time consuming, i'm in one that takes maybe 10 hours a semester total and is still great for my resume- and i'm of the strong opinion that you only hate this town if you actively try to not be open to all it has to offer. 

i'd also like to quote the fiske guide to colleges at you because i think it's a cool summary and a brilliant guide in general-

>like most big, public universities, u of i has a barn full of choices, and with a strong greek system and 1,000 clubs, social activities are more than plentiful. homecoming weekend was invented at the university of illinois, and whether cheering for the illini, pledging a greek organization, or celebrating moms', dads', or siblings' weekends, students here stir up a vibrant mix of school spirit and good times. this may look and feel like a laid-back midwestern campus, but make no mistake: illinois's stellar academics and learning communities are on par with any of the country's public flagships.

some classes will be hard, some will be easy, some will be taught passionate and driven professors, some will have lackluster ones that don't care as much. scheduling is hard everywhere, especially at large research universities that have so many students. it's bound to happen. 

at the same time, the work load is something we all face. it's no longer high school, and responsibilities change drastically. it's difficult, and it'll take a while to get used to. but you're all in this together, and will get through it together. it'll get easier to manage time, and prioritize the things you enjoy. what do you enjoy? 

from your comments so far, it sounds like college wasn't your choice at all. do you like your major? do you hate University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign because it's bad, or because of bad circumstances that put you here?

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/comments/ggw63d/6_reasons_why_you_shouldnt_come_to_University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign_not/,"hey there,

i hear you. i really do. your concerns are valid, albeit a little privileged, but that's okay. simply making inferences from your responses to your other posts, i can sort of see that you come from an affluent community so i understand why you regard University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in this manner whereas someone from a different sort of socioeconomic upbringing may have a different perspective. you're not wrong in thinking that your college experience hasn't been great. if there's one thing i've noticed, it's that college can be a tough time - both socially and academically. 

for me i went through high school thinking that my life would get better once i got to college. i was wrong in so many ways. although i definitely didn't peak in high school, i also didn't get the college experience i thought i was going to get. you're not wrong for thinking college is supposed to be this magical experience. i mean look at how college is portrayed in the movies. it always seems like a young person goes to college, meets a bunch of cool people, and has a lot of fun there. the harsh reality is that the transition to college is *tough,* at least for most people. think about it. you're moving to a brand new location, sleeping in a brand new bed, learning material at twice the speed from (some inadequate) professors, and trying to meet new people all at once. for the past 18 years of your life, you have't had to do any of this. now you're trying to relearn how to make friends, lie on your own, and adjust to a new environment. everyone rats on high school. but we forget how comforted and safe we were. we had a solid group of friends to fulfill our social needs, we had sports with our best teammates and favorite coaches, and we had teachers who ***genuinely*** cared of us. i never thought i'd say this, but maybe i miss high school, if only a little bit. i'm not saying high school is the best times of our lives, but for most of us, it's definitely a fond time to look back on. on top of this, like you mention, you have tough material to learn and if you don't master it right away, you risk failing. 

i empathize for you. i really do. you're taking a bunch of difficult classes in a brand new environment. that's tough. although i disagree that University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign engineering isn't prestigious. it is an incredible program. i'm not in the program, but i know it's highly regarded in the nation. 

so i encourage you to stop looking at what you don't have, and start appreciating what you do. i want to remind you that in a world that wants everything quickly and at their fingertips, **good things take time and that all good things come with moderation.** hang in there. you're only a freshmen. you have time to continue grinding through this. only three more years and you'll be done. i also want to remind you that the rigor of your program shows how good of a school this is. i have friends who go to ""easier"" universities such as depaul or lewis. not to put those schools down, but i never hear them complain about the rigor or course work and some day it's easier than high school. do with that what you will. life after college is very different. i can't wait for the day i get off work at 5pm and i can say to myself ""i'm done for the day! i think i am going to devote this afternoon doing stuff that makes me happy."" that's certainly not something most of us can say as students at a rigorous university. 

&#x200b;

lastly, you will always be your biggest hater. if there's one thing i've learned, everyone is caught up thinking of how others are judging/perceiving them. no one thinks about you more than you do yourself. everyone is too busy in their own worlds and if you encounter someone who laughs at where you got your degree, then maybe that's not someone you'd want to associate yourself with. i know i wouldn't.",Comment,Neutral
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/comments/ggw63d/6_reasons_why_you_shouldnt_come_to_University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign_not/,"hey, i know i'm a little late to the party but i thought i should share my thoughts.

so, i was raised in illinois as well, but when i began college i went to a small liberal arts school on the east coast. it's where my dad went, and it held decent prestige, enough to make my parents happy at least. 

here is what i thought about my time there: i didn't feel like i enjoyed it there, just environment wise. it was small, after all and it felt isolated from the outside world. i actually loved the academics. it wasn't overly stressful, classes were small, had professors who looked after their students etc. basically what it sounds like you want for your classes. also, the people i met there were all amazing. everyone was so nice.

doesn't sound that bad right? thing is, my opinions at the time were so dramatically different. i was disgusted at how ""easy"" things were for a school of such academic prestige. i felt like everyone was so fake and i didn't fit in with them. i hated how closed off it felt. i can't even put into words how much i wanted to leave. i transferred after my first semester - meaning i was working on my transfer application before my first semester had even ended.

when i made the decision to transfer to illinois, i received extremely strong pushback from my parents. it hurt our relationship in a way that i feel still has not recovered. without getting into many details, the main issue i could tell was absolutely the prestige difference. yeah, illinois carries a reputation for being a state party school. but it does also boast a top engineering program, even if your parents, like mine, could not see that.

i trekked through my remaining 3.5 years of college with many ups and many downs. i still struggled to fit in here sometimes, and i struggled in school enough to make me want to transfer back to my previous university. but in the end, i managed to find some great people, and i managed to complete my degree, something i am extremely proud of considering the work i put into it. i received an offer for my dream company, vindicating my decision to transfer to a ""state party school."" 

i get my story sounds like an incoherent mess since i'm a shitty writer but the points i wanted to make were

1. i know it's really fucking hard, but try to look for positives. before i transferred i was so fixated on why my school sucked that i twisted my opinions (nice people = fake, etc) to make myself hate it more. i see you doing that with #7, obviously crying in cbtf is a joke but you cling onto that ounce of truth to make it into a valid point to fuel the hatred. i did it too so i get it. only years later i'm able to look back on it positively, which is also in part due to the fact that

2. time, and relativity, almost always makes things seem better than they actually were. for example, midway through college i was reflecting on high school being amazing, due to me generally forgetting about the bad emotions and because college was just so much harder it made hs seem easy. likewise, i'd imagine as i start to work i'll begin to miss college more and more. so don't be so quick to think ""man, i'm not enjoying myself 100% of the time right now, how is college the best time of my life?"" trust me, i used to think this too but that's generally not how it plays out.

3. start to think more for yourself rather than for other people. you're working your ass off right now, aren't you proud of it? when you graduate, maybe people won't be impressed by your degree as much as if it was at Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University , but what's that mean to you? i know what my degree is worth, and that's all that matters to me. my parents, or random people on the street be damned. if you still need validation from them, then 

4. do it with your career. i get to tell people i work at x company which is a far bigger flex than my undergraduate degree ever will be, even if i went to an ivy league or oxford.  after a year into your career who's asking where you went to school?

i hope my story helps you see things a little differently. i didn't want to go line by line and address all your points so as to not make it a debate, but if you still have concerns about anything i didn't touch on, or any further discussion/elaboration/clarification on anything i said please pm me! i went through everything on my own way back when, with very few people understanding what i was truly going through so i would love to talk",Comment,Neutral

1. this sadly happens at pretty much every college. gen ed reqs should not be a thing. but then again this a college problem, not a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign problem.
2. can't comment
3. this is just an issue at most large research universities. teaching performance doesn't really matter compared to research, and admin def doesn't care if you fail.
4. sorry, but either git gud or don't be too surprised if you need to spend extra time. you chose a ""hard"" major, and should not be surprised if your life reflects what people online talk of engineering. engineering curriculums have lots of classes to maintain stuff like abet accreditation and to give you a decent breadth introduction to the field in general. there will be plenty of classes that you hate and will never use again in your major, but again that's just reality of college education.
5. this is your \*own\* experience. i know plenty of engineering kids who can manage their schedule and have lots of free time. i can't really help you here because you really need to find the most time efficient learning strategies for yourself, and most general studying advice might be bs for a lot of people.

i agree on the gened situation and while it s certainly not ideal, unfortunately that s the way it is especially at large schools like this.  obviously, you ve had a bad experience, but hopefully you ll find better professors/classes in the future because they certainly are out there.  i certainly don t know your experience, but i do think it s still partly something you ll adjust in terms of being overworked or overloaded with homework/studying.  especially as you progress and have less geneds and smaller classes, the work you do have will hopefully be more meaningful to you and professors become more accesible.  there s always one class every semester i complain about how awfully it s run, but in my experience it does get better and you ll also get better at handling college.

in terms of scheduling classes and your overall course schedule, while yes i agree scheduling classes is annoying and the total class load is a bit ridiculous for engineering, that s simply the way it is, and other schools aren t going be different.  as a freshman, you get bad time slots for registration which really sucks and often times only one professor s section fits your section or you they don t tell you or you have no say in if your ta will be competent.  this is sadly the case at any large university with so many classes and professors to coordinate.  again it gets better later with smaller classes and more specific major classes, but i agree, it s far from ideal.  also, yes, engineering curriculums suck, and some are almost impossible to (reasonably) complete in 4 years without coming in with credits or winter/summer credit.  that s part of the difficulty of engineering, and i know many who have or will take extra semester(s).  this is how it is being in engineering anywhere though, the other top schools you mentioned have rigorous engineering curriculums as well; we just need to learn a lot to become good engineers, so there are a lot of classes.  

well, this is super long already, so i won t drag this out, but the only thing i really don t agree on is that a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign degree (especially in engineering) doesn t mean that as much as it should.  yes, plenty of people don t understand how good/hard our engineering program is and won t give you credit, but the people who do care like employers, grad schools, etc, definitely know in the engineering space.  i m not sure what people you re referring to or what people you ve experienced not respect you coming here as much as it deserves, but it is far from looked as the same as niu or eiu or something.  in terms of work/internships, recruiters have definitely respected me more for going to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  some have reached out me specifically for positions saying they wanted a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign student for example, but i think the best example i have is this.  when i got my current summer position, one of the first things they told me was  oh, you know our company president is a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign alum!  you need to set up a meeting with him to talk!   this is a california/seattle tech company.  i m proud to be getting a degree from here and to most of the people who matter, they respect it as well.

i hope this is encouraging rather than taken as simply disagreeing, but unfortunately a lot of what you re saying is simply how engineering in college is anywhere.  i think freshman year especially it can be rough even more so with how crazy this semester has been.  i do really hope the following years get better for you.",Comment,Neutral

the other thing i'd like to point out is being a ta for a general class is hard, and mostly because it is hard to stay always pleasant. the low level cs courses (for example, 225) are going to be populated with lots of freshmen/sophomores, some of which are trying to get into cs and want/need to do well. and (maybe i'm being a little blunt here) not all of them are good enough to get into cs. so some of the tas are going to get asked the same stupid questions (and while they may be valid, hearing people ask a fairly elementary question 15 times is annoying) so they naturally become a little more condescending. compare that to the 400-500 level classes; these are almost always going to be smaller than the low level cs classes, so there is less work involved. these are going to usually be populated with juniors and seniors, so they have other resources they use to get help (ask friends, people who have taken the class before, past solutions) or they just have a stronger grasp of the material in general, so you get a lot less dumb questions.

course assistants are chosen, like in other departments, by a combination of good grades and instructor recommendations. the conversation you overheard was likely an instructor talking to a student they recognized as one of the best in their class.

cs241 is particularly challenging course to assist for, especially this semwster, because lawrence is changing the course material significantly. he couldn't hire experienced assistants, because *nobody has taken the course before* in its current incarnation. cs 374 doesn't have quite the same excuse, but the number of people who took it before this semester is pretty small, and they all took it from me.

for cs, i got contacted by cinda after taking the class based on performance. when i was taing, she only asked if there was anyone we noticed in discussions / piazza that we thought would be a good fit for future semesters -- i had no serious influence over future tas. she made the final decisions and given how competitive 225 taing is, i'm sure everyone picked is qualified to be there in terms of knowledge of the material. maybe some people aren't the best at explaining things, but they're students and they have good intentions.

i'd be very, very surprised if someone got penalized for cheating and were actually innocent. i was closely involved with a case in 225 and without getting into details, it's legitimate. if anything, i'd say it's too lenient.

but this is all for 225. i know i had some very bad cas for 125 when angrave was teaching it. during discussion sections i heard them making jokes to each other about how easy what we were working on was, and they weren't particularly helpful.

regarding ta behavior, honestly i think it's a problem across the cs department undergrads. students would complain that the tas wouldn't just tell them the answer. students complain that the assignments aren't explicit enough when the point is that the student has to decide on the best implementations. students ask for help when they've put in no effort to solve their problems on their own (e.g. they get a seg fault and immediately ask the ta to debug). people insult professors for making math mistakes during lecture. i don't know if it's the pressure of assignments making people make bad decisions, but it's really an unpleasant environment. i only had these problems in cs -- the chem department had a way different atmosphere. tas being snarky is not okay, but it seems like the department has so much snark it isn't too surprising that some of it seeps into the ta pool as well.

cinda seems to have some magic for filtering this out though. my favorite part of taing for 225 was that i met a bunch of cs students that ended up becoming good friends with. just my experience here.

for some chem perspective: taing for gen chem had an application where you got professor recommendations and what not, but when we went to our first orientation meeting they asked us to tell any friends that they were pretty desperate for tas since they were short staffed. my impression was that pretty much anyone that got an a would be given a job if they wanted it. we worked more hours than we got paid for since the department didn't have that much money to give out to us. students seem less excited to ta chem than cs for whatever reason.",Comment,Positive

ug tas (i.e. cas), at least to me, seem to be chosen based on interest, academic performance, and by extension, your impression on the instructor/course staff responsible for hiring cas. as far as i know, there's no formal matchmaking process beyond that - which, combined with immaturity, leads to relatively (in the literal sense) poor course staff.

i suppose, just to elaborate on the maturity aspect a bit: as a ca, you've taken the class, you've done well in the class, so you've mastered the material. odds are you haven't run into a space yet where you've felt totally out of your element - and as such, you aren't necessarily cognizant of the fact that some people might grasp some material more easily than others. as a grad student, you're (used to?) feeling like you know something and nothing at the same time - so you understand that there's honestly no dumb question (within some sane liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys, of course). this really boils down to an experience/patience thing, for better or for worse.

to my knowledge, cheating is still primarily detected via moss. i should read the paper since it's probably answered there, but i'm curious as to what it does if you get similar correct answers for an ""easy"" assignment that doesn't allow for much variability.

with respect to cheating, my job is to point it out to the instructor, then start gathering evidence so that it's incontrovertible. we don't pursue cases that are iffy precisely because of cases like ed's.",Comment,Neutral

edit: i want to add that i did transfer 4 years ago and have since graduated. i don't know exactly what the transfer requirements are looking like now. basically i'm saying dgs allowed me to obtain a degree from a program that i'm sure i would have been denied from had i applied to it from high school. and i think there's value in having such an opportunity. obviously it's easy for me to say as it did all work out. i can't imagine what i would have done if i had been denied my transfer. probably would've had to transfer schools. which i can see how that would be a very different situation to have to go through, but that's just part of what you need to agree to before accepting to attend as dgs.",Comment,Neutral

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/comments/kd9tp7/my_thoughts_on_cs_culture_this_semester/,"definitely relatable. as a physics major who is doing a cs minor, when i was in cs 125 last semester, i did receive help from some nice people (like ben nordick), but there were also many arrogant course staffs who are being not very helpful and patient. however, i've never seen such situation in the physics community; ppl were always trying their best helping each other. i guess here is the reason that makes the different:

for physics majors, everyone is fucked up by physics. no matter how smart you are, there's always something that you don't know. so we are aware that there's something beyond our liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys and we tend to not to flex on each other.

in cs, some people think they are smart and look short on the others because they are in cs, this most selective major in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and they are (possibly) gonna earn 6 figure as fresh grads. however, admission into cs being selective is not because of the knowledge is hard. if that is the case, then physics, aeroe and ee are going to be the most selective majors in engineering. rather, it's because people are crowded into cs. getting a decent wage is also not due to intellectual sharpness, but rather a high average in the industry. the huge shortage in cs grad supply boots up people's ego and creates wrong impression of themselves in some cs people's minds.

i think the main reason accouting for the toxic culture is that some cs ppl have really liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed scopes. in their worlds, there are only score of a mp, internship placement, or grades in cs 374. they only interact with people in the community, and they only talk about classes, internships, and programming languages. they compare with others to fulfill their ego. however, there are much more things to learn in this world and they ignore them all.

also being a ca in cs 101, given that i've witnessed the toxic culture in cs, i tried my best to provide useful help and being patient. although some questions seemed obvious and easy and some students couldn't get it for the first time, i always explained in details while being patient until the student understands. i am aware that no one was born with programming skills, and all of us learned it from 'hello world'. a course staff's job is to provide students with encouragement, instead of showing the students they are better than them.",Comment,Neutral

i wish this wasn't such a widespread problem, but i think it unfortunately comes with the territory of being a ""prestigious"" school for a certain discipline because you're bound to attract pre-profressional types and people that have never talked about something that has happened outside of a classroom. so it goes i guess.",Comment,Neutral
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/comments/kd9tp7/my_thoughts_on_cs_culture_this_semester/,"i come from a quite different cultural background, but some of your struggles are surprisingly relatable to me. i finished my cs undergrad in taiwan this year, and i was also an exchange student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign during my last semester. i only stayed at this school for two months, so i wouldn't say i know much about this place. but in terms of mps or exams, it's pretty similar to what we have at my home school.

i totally understand what you mean by those people who like to find new, fancy, technological ways to solve problems. those kind of people annoy me so much as well. because, to me, technology is only a tool to solve problems, not the final goal. it's ridiculous to spend most of your time sharpening your knife, without knowing what value in life you want to guard with this weapon. i've always been fascinated with human nature. i like explore how others think, and i really care how they feel. but i always find myself kind of isolated from others, because not many people in cs think like i do. they tend to care about the technology, not how people feel.

i've always thought this is a cultural problem. i thought it's because eastern culture tend to be more conservative, and we don't ""talk about it"" as much as the western society. but after seeing your opinion, i think maybe it's more like a cs problem. we're not humane, or compassionate enough.

my solution? i'm still trying. but i guess i have to find my own group of friends who share the same belief, which means i need to put myself out there and see what kind of friends still stay with me even though i always speak my own truth. you really don't need to be everyone's friend.

sometimes culture is a weird thing to talk about. once you meet the right/wrong group of people, even though those few people do not represent the whole culture, you still think you love/hate this culture.

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/comments/kd9tp7/my_thoughts_on_cs_culture_this_semester/,"op, i think you nailed this perfectly. i guess i'm a bit of an old geezer around here (super-senior because of my double major in political science to add on to my stats and cs major), but i think everything you have written is extremely accurate about the cs culture and how it has been cultivated over the last few years. to be fair, i can't speak for how the culture has been like this semester because i was working on a political campaign the past few months (which even though it was my dream job, some peers in the department ridiculed me because it wasn't a tech industry job). that being said, your sentiment is most definitely accurate given my past experiences.

there is an absolute ton of gaslighting, toxic masculinity, egoism, you name it, in the computer science culture here, and i have been in the exact same boat as you. it's ironic, because at any place i've worked at (not trying to brag about any career achievements but listing these to showcase my sentiment remains intact across a wide variety of industries - in fintech, at a faang company, for the us government in both the halls of congress and doing tech at one of the executive branch agencies, and on financial data on a political campaign), not one of these places comes close to the gaslighting, toxic masculinity, and negativity that i have seen during my years here. not even close. but imagine that for a second - **you know your major's culture is absolutely and massively fucked up** if the halls of *the united states congress* have less gaslighting, toxicity, and egoism than what is produced by your peers in a computer science department. it is pathetic, immature, ignorant, and quite frankly - small. the university of illinois is a world-class university, and this is the absolute fucking best we apparently have to offer in terms of computer science culture? wow.

so, *at the very least*, this culture is not as existent in the real world (especially if you don't work in faang, which to be honest is quite overrated and the perks get old real quick). **as long as you surround yourself with the right people here and in the real world, the experiences that you've had in tech here at u of i won't be as bad once you graduate**. my sentiment is similar with interning too: i've found my intern and work colleagues to be way less participative of these qualities than my u of i computer science peers, and when i've talked previously about how these qualities are a problem, my colleagues were appalled that it was this bad).

the tech bro culture here is a rampant disease that becomes more consuming the longer you stay here, and time and time again i've seen people fall into it. just sharing personal experiences, but i've had close friends who were at one point against that culture get extremely jealous when i got an internship offer at a faang company, and who told other people i was going to fail just to deal with their own insecurity. i've been mocked for wanting to go down my own path and take an extra semester to double major in a field i have been passionate about since i was a child, rather than go into faang like everyone else. i have also been told i was overreacting or being mean when i didn't like the culture that the university was cultivating. i know of people who literally mocked other university of illinois students for not being in computer science.

i understand your experiences and your pain because i have been there, and you and others are not alone in feeling this alienation and feeling disconnected and disappointed as a result.

it took me a while to accept my peace with the culture here. i don't hold any grudges and i'm not mad. yet to this day, it is still absolutely mind-boggling how many students in the department judge another human being by their standards of success and their timeline rather than that human's standards of success and that human's timeline. the number of people who will ridicule others who don't get a faang internship or a job on the west coast during their time here amazes me. *who the fuck cares?* that lack of understanding leads to massive lapses in ethics and caring. the department and the student body absolutely needs to do something about it, and i don't think a simple one-hour conversation is something that will cover it. unfortunately, a massive shift in culture like this will probably have to take years, long after we graduate.

one of the only ways to escape this elitism and toxic mentality that occurs in this department is to surround yourself with different experiences and with different people. some of the ways that i found that i grew the most as a student and more importantly, as a person, was by escaping the constant faang-obsessed mob mentality and doing things out of my comfort zone. i made my closest friendships here with people who weren't in computer science. i did a study program in washington, dc (illinois in washington) and lived with a bunch of political science students who to this day are some of my closest buddies (even though i'm way more of a cs student than a political science one). heck, when i was deciding between two locations to intern when i flirted with faang, i chose the location where i wouldn't be by my college friends so i could grow as a person, meet new people, and have different experiences with different people. even if you don't have the luxury of studying or working in a different field or place, taking yourself out of the constant 24/7 tech grind does wonders to your emotional maturity and your mental health.

looking back, that lack of finding new experiences and surrounding oneself with people of different backgrounds holds back the cs culture here. sure, one gets to grow a coding skillset, but who fucking cares? you don't get to grow as a person, and because you're surrounded with this echo chamber of elitism, egoism, and toxicity and because you're constantly surrounded by the same people, this constant competitiveness and constant desire to prove that you're better than everyone else and to bring down other people who don't follow your path becomes rampant. interact less with toxic peers and more with people of different backgrounds, and you'll be able to combat the cs environment with a wide variety of amazing experiences.",Comment,Neutral

more concerning is the possibility that a large chunk of people around me  perhaps even i myself  have been contributing to this problem without me realizing. that s why i m very thankful for you speaking up when you see issues, and encouraging others to do the same. i don t mean to imply that everyone contributing to this problem is doing so on accident, and i m sure people will become defensive when confronted, but i think by drawing light to these issues when they come up, you can help people (bystanders too, not just those involved) identify the problematic behaviors and take steps themselves to combat this toxicity. 

i m perfectly fine with getting called out myself, as long as it means that i can help foster a welcoming environment within the major i fell in love with freshman year; i would be overjoyed if more people were able to see the field in the same light i do. i hope there are many others in cs who feel the same.

that being said, i really don't you should be generalizing everyone who studies cs as being ""soulless"".  i don't think you have a right to criticize people for focusing 24/7 on their career and studies.  whether or not that is worth for them to do, is entirely not up to some acquaintance to decide.   it's fine to try and understand what other people are going through, but don't decide whether what they're doing is right or not.  all that does is lead to pointless stress and anger and you come off looking like the same kind of person you're currently criticizing.",Comment,Neutral

i kinda feel you. i'm not cs/ece/etc (as per my flair) but i feel like i dodged a bullet with regards to it. i'd always been the ""smart one"", and i think a lot of cs majors were as well. coming out of highschool, i was choosing between business and cs - i eventually applied to bus, but i think i could have gotten adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted in cs. i spent the summer after hs in the same kind of mindset. i was focused on  being elite, having a prestigious major, getting a high-paying job after graduation, the works.

but about a week and a half into the semester, i was a wreck. i hated it - i hated the competition, i hated the elitist mindset, i hated how it felt like a factory or spawning pool for the next generation of drones. i called my mom in tears multiple times. i hated it. so i left. i transferred out of the cob after fall semester, and spent spring figuring out what i really wanted to do in life.

i eventually transferred into history - one of the majors you specifically mentioned to be seen as ""useless"". but it is my passion. i love thinking critically, making an argument, whatever. i finally felt like i was being educated instead of trained. now i'm planning on going to grad school for my ms in library science, so i can get a job that has a purpose to me beyond just making money.

with regards to your comments on geneds: i absolutely agree. geneds are one of my favorite things about my major. i have so much leeway to explore all kinds of topics. i discovered that i really like english classes, i really like classical civ classes. i honestly feel bad for all the cs majors that can't afford the time in their schedules to explore other subjects.

example: i like philosophy a bunch and did like phil 206 or whatever, and was super excited to meet people who cared about phil... and while the people i met did, in fact, care about philosophy, they also happened to be a bunch of conceited assholes who thought that just because they didn't understand kant meant he was wrong. my professor was a fantastic person, and i loved learning from her, and i did have several classmates who  were nice to talk to - but the overwhelming majority seemed convinced that they knew everything and insisted that there was no way they could ever be wrong (the only thing saving me here is that i'm 100% convinced that i literally know nothing, and pretty much never have my own original thoughts cause i'm too stupid for those). 

example 2: lit majors? i always thought these people would be cool and like bingeread james joyce and circlejerk raskolnikov or allende or something at the very least - but instead 100% of the ones i've met seem to mostly be interested in harry potter. to be fair, i haven't met many (like less than 5), but it's still a bit frustrating.

the grass is always greener, and being obnoxious about this won't get you anywhere - but generally, i'd say every major's terrible. now get off your high horse, do what you like, and meet some decent people.

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/comments/8b3yk2/cs_makes_me_sick/,"as   a cs major myself,   cs was once   cool and   fancy to   me.   it   was   indeed pretty cool   at 200 level   classes. when people   ask what my major is,   i proudly told them   i   am   cs, and   then   there   is immediately the   impression: 'you   are   so   smart!'.   i   used   to enjoy   this kinda   of   feeling.   but after   2   years in cs, i   have become sickened and disgusted   by   this major,   and the   cs stereotype that could   be found   on   at least   half   of kids.   

cs people   think   they   are   the   best of   the   world, smarter   than   all   other people. they look   down upon   all   other   majors. they   think   people   studying   humanities are   either   dumb   or stupid.   they   might   not appear it, but that's what they think   low key.   there   are   too many occasions that   when   they   heard   someone is   studying majors like   history   or philosophy, they   have   the   expression that 'why   do   you   study   that?   are you   gonna   find   a job   at   all?' 

cs people   always   think   what   they   are   doing is   the   most important in   this world.   this   self-importance   is even   more   exaggerated when   they go to   career fairs. after   all,  almost   half of   companies in   career fair   want   cs people.   but  you are   just   a replaceable screw in   such   field with countless brilliant minds.   i   just don t understand   what make   cs people feel   so   good about themselves. come   on,   it s   just   a living   with   better pays. i   would rather   live with   60k a   year being interesting rather than   120k being   boring.   

cs people   are incredibly boring. when   i   dine with   cs people,   either in   large group or one-to-one,   the   topic is   always   gonna   be about   four   things: class, homework, research and interview. there   seems   to   be   nothing else   in their life. if there   is,   it s   probably   video   game.   this is   also largely true   for the   people   working   in the industry. i have   interned at   a top   silicon valley tech company.   i   tried   to   talk about   something   other   than   technical or   working   stuff. i   mean   i know   pretty   a   lot stuff   and   can   discuss intellectually on most topics,   but the   colleagues in my group   just   can t   keep   the   conversation   informative and   inspiring.   

some people   enjoy   cs technical jokes.   come   on, by   all   means,   they   are   lame, uninteresting, uncool and  not funny at   all.   no people   outside the field will   like   them.   it   only makes   you nerdier. 

occasionally, my   friends will ask   for some easy   gen-eds. they don t care   the   slightest about   whether   the   professor   is interesting or   fun. they don t care   whether   the   course provides real inspiration   or broadens version.   they   just want gen-eds not to   be   the   burden   of   their life.   how pathetic. i   mean   you   guys   paid   thousands of dollars   a year   just to take   some easy   boring   classes? University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is   probably   not   the most   prestigious institutions for   humanities and   arts, but its   offering of gen-eds courses   is   full and   complete   and fairly good. there   is   just plenty  of   cs courses   and coding tutorials online   that   are no worse  than University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign cs course   offering. why   the heck   you   go   to college anyway?   

cs people   are just bunch of   programmers, as   they tell   the computer to do   whatever   they   want,   they   are   just told   to   do whatever   the   their boss   wants.   there   is very   little   to none creativity,   artistry, or   craftsmanship of   any kind.   

it s   not   my personal opinion.   it s   true. i ve   been  a   software engineer. you   can   go   to   street   or anywhere and   ask   which   is cooler,   an artist   or a   software engineer. i   doubt if   there will   be many would   answer   software engineer. 

i m   determined that   i will stay   away   from cs for   my entire   life. (it's good   to   know   the   knowledge though) cs people   don t   have souls (not   all   of   them,   but   a great number   of   them). as   jeff hammberbacher (the   guy   who   co-founded cloudera) famously said,    the   best   minds   of my   generation   are thinking   about   how to make   people   click   ads.   that   sucks .   i don t   know   whether   i   should   feel   sorry   or   feel angry.   it certainly   makes   me  sad.   

being   smart is certainly great.   but   intelligence should   be used on   more interesting   stuff.   i respect   that people s   wish   to   be financially successful. and   i   understand that,   for   smart kids,   cs is   a   shortcut. but   i just want to   tell you world is not   all about cs. there   are   plenty of interesting   things   out there   to   be   discovered.   i have   no   complaint if   you tried bit   of   everything   and   finally   find   that   cs is your love.   but   it would be   the   stupidest of   you to   think   cs the   greatest of   all,   while   being   ignorant   of   other stuff   and   feeling   complacent about   yourself.   unfortunately,   based on my   observation,   it   is   happening pervasively among   cs people.   i   respect   those   people   who   are   truly   attracted to cs and   have   the determination to   devote life to   it (be   a professor   etc). at   least   some   of   you   should   draw   a   clear line   between   what  is work and   what   is   real   meaning   of   life.   i   wish   this   post   would   make a difference,   although   i   don t   have   much confidence in   that. people   just   forget   about this   in day   and continue   their   cycle of lecture,   deadline, interview and video games.   

now, when   people   ask   for   my   major, i tell   them   it   doesn t matter.   know   all   those   above because   i meet   them every   single   for the past 2   years. i   know   these   people too   well.   yes,   i use   pronoun 'they'   when   i talk   about   cs people.  i used   to   be   one of them.   but not any   more.

you want to pin cs people as soulless uncreative minions of darkness, but that just makes it clear to me that you don't appreciate algorithms or software engineering. there is plenty of opportunity for creativity in the choices you make when designing a software architecture. you may not see that if you are still green, but it's there.

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/comments/8b3yk2/cs_makes_me_sick/,"you make some solid points but i think your frustration is aimed at the wrong spot. i agree with many of the points you made, and as an ex-cs major, i fully think the culture you're talking about is to blame partly if not fully on the engineering/cs departments themselves. they've designed these majors to be extremely stressful and overbearing to a point that it makes wanting to pursue the major completely impossible for some. 

as a main point i want to point out the way credit hours is used for the classes. let's say you're a freshman in cs and it's your second semester. you're classes for the semester are cs 173, calc ii, phys 211, and ps 100 as a gen ed. grand total of a 13 credit semester so pretty lax semester right? wrong. now let's look at their credit hour breakdown. 173 = 3 credits, calc ii = 3 credits, 211 = 4 credits, and ps = 3 credits. now ps 100 meets 3 times a week for an hour each visit so the 3 credit hours works. cs 173 meets for an 1 hour and 30 mins twice a week then has a 2 hour lab. wouldn't you think that meant it would be a 5 credit since you're spending 5 hours in the class? let's look at calc ii, you meet every day for 3 hours of lecture and 2 hours of discussion, so wouldn't you think that'd be considered a 5 hour as well? then there's phys 211, which i'd consider to be the introduction course to any engineering major, you meet for an hour mwf then 2 hour lab and a 2 hour discussion...that's 7 hours doing 211! if we followed the common rule of study 2-3 hours per credit hour, people would be doing 8.5 hours of studying per day everyday for that 13 credit hour semester (which is really a 20 hour semester). how are you even suppose to have time to do anything?? 

now i get engineering is meant to challenge but that schedule is a normal schedule for most freshman engineering or prospective engineering students either their first or second semester here. a schedule like that for someone who may not have had the strongest background in calc or physics will get their ass destroyed by this schedule. and many do. the gpa averages for calc 2 and physics 211 are absurdly low for being introductory courses to the more advance engineering courses. anyone who might have the passion for cs/engineering has to have the intelligence right off the bat or the mental fortitude to study for those courses religiously. in my opinion this does the entire department a disservice, you are crippling minds as soon as they entire the atmosphere and those who can successfully get through it develop this superiority complex because in reality they just accomplished something no sane department would put their students through! and of course these same students wouldn't have much interest for gen eds or talking about anything else that isn't engineering/cs cuz they have no time to devot to anything else! 

this school needs to understand that trying to compress an engineering degree into 4 years (even though the average time it takes to complete an undergrad now-a-days is 6 years) is only going to destroy their student base. i know so many people who are ridiculously intelligent that have had mental breakdowns because they just couldn't keep up anymore. it's not like the bs with the credit worth stops after the 200 series, that nonsense continues till the end. 

yet all of this could be avoided if they simply gave the classes their true credit worth and extended engineering/cs to a 5 or 6 year program. if you can/want to completely it sooner then by all means go ahead but by forcing all the student body who is capable of being great engineers to do so much and learn so much in such a small amount of time is just inconceivable. 

yes cs and other engineering/stem majors have this annoying superiority complex and yes they have extremely liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed social skills at times, but for the most part they don't have the means to really change that when they have so much academia to do. other majors equal out their class credit worth and that's why they have time to be in clubs and develop social skills and do the more normal college things. 

it's honestly depressing how far the university is willing to push and break their students just to squeeze out a handful of ""geniuses"". it's almost like they do it to market themselves as a top tier college even though the only reason it's top tier is cuz it rushes the shit outta the curriculum.

**free things aka its good to be a student:**

[icard discounts] (http://www.icard.uillinois.edu/dsp_categories.cfm?group=urbanaperks)

free condoms, lube, cold kits, bandaids, pregnancy tests and antifungal at mckinley

all buses are free with an icard.
*how to use the bus system*
from jinglehymrshMassachusetts Institute of Technology:
go to cumtd.com. there you can plug in your desired route. you can use building names, street intersections, and addresses. i prefer to use cumtd vs google maps because the cumtd website uses gps info from its buses so its times are more accurate (usually). once you learn the bus routes that are useful to you i recommended either using one of the free iphone/android apps that utilize the cumtd stopwatch. basically this allows you to plug in your stop and it will tell you which buses are arriving there and when. this is the same technology that you can also use by texting cumtd your stop number and it texts you back the bus info. to text cumtd look at the signs by the bus stops and it will give you directions.
you don't need to use your icard on campus for the 13 silver (which goes from par/far on the west side of the quad, to downtown urbana), the 12 teal (which goes from  par/far up the east side of campus to downtown champaign) or the 22

from yayz0rs: during the school year, each cultural house (asian american, african american, native american, etc.) has a [free lunch program] (http://studentaffairs.illinois.edu/diversity/lunch.html), you go in get free food and get to listen to a lecture.

the food is usually from local restaurants and the lectures are usually pretty good, but if they're not your thing you can just leave no one will care. they're also all on separate days, so m-f you can get free lunch at i think 12-1. schedule accordingly! i know a lot of my friends do.

**quick tips:**
do not go to mckinley without an appointment--you will wait forever, at least an hour. they save slots for same day appointments--call whenever you can. dial-a-nurse is great, and help you decide whether you need to go to the doctor or the hospital. mckinley also does xrays and all sorts of blood tests, std tests, and has a great women's resource center for all your lady needs.

from tardisgater: join a club. most people think that they will find friends at the dorms or classes, but that is based on the idea that you will have a sociable floor and that you will always sit next to the same people (in a 300 person lecture...)

 from spotsmcdots:
there is a nutritionist on campus you can see for free. you can ask about her in the wellness center in the basement of the union.

you can get a stacks pass regardless of if you are a james scholar. all you have to do is walk up to one of the librarians at the desk in front of the stacks and ask for a stacks pass. it is really that simple.

there is a beauty institute in champaign called regency where you can get your hair done very inexpensively. as long as you are willing to take the bus over by marketplace, you can save a ton of money if you regularly get things like color or chemical treatments.

from awhitesuit:
two local record stores: exile on main st in downtown champaign and parasol near downtown urbana

from mysassyassy:
the one thing that i would recommend buying is a memory foam mattress topper (10 lb) from ebay. since you spend a third of your time sleeping (or more), it brings a lot of relief (no body aches), especially during the more stressful parts of the semester. i bought mine for around 40 bucks and it was legit (not the one from target or walmart) because it was a factory irregular (had a bit of writing on it, but easy to clean). also, another recommendation is a clipboard, it saves paper, frees up a lot of room in the back pack and will have more room in the crowded lecture rooms since you won't need to use the tiny desks. 


**how do i get outta this town**
getting to the burbs and chicago is easy: see advice below. peoria, lex, and suburban all offer buses to chicago and the surburbs, and offer free wifi sometimes. many people have bad experiences with lex, but they will pick you up from your dorm and take you to your suburb every time--you pick the route. it will probably take you longer and they might show up late, but they're not the evil thing suburban advertises them as. suburban is very punctual, but often only offers trips to the biggest suburbs at non-peak times, and won't let you change your ticket. peoria charter kicks ass.

from spotsmcdots:
while lincolnland express(lex) and suburban express cater the most to students who want to travel off campus, there are cheaper alternatives. greyhound, megabus, and amtrak can be significantly cheaper, but have fewer options and only picks up at illinois terminal. some other area travel companies are peoria charter and burlington trailways for further options. --burlington and megabus at least will take you to isu to visit friends.

if you want to fly out of the area, you can do student standby with airtran out of bmi to orlando, ft.myers, or atlanta for $70 one way. it can make for a cheap getaway, but you have to be really flexible since bmi doesn't have a lot of nonstop flights (not for everyone!). you can get the same deal out of mdw.

sometimes it will be cheaper or equal price to fly out of bmi versus ord or mdw. the trip costs about as much as the ticket to chicago in some instances, but you can save a lot of time since bmi is significantly closer.

when i was a freshman i did not make an effort to understand the bus system. i lived in a dorm right next to the quad, so i didn't really feel i needed to and frankly i was a bit overwhelmed by it all. the buses are a great way to get around and if you put in 10 min to learn it would be worth it.

go to cumtd.com. there you can plug in your desired route. you can use building names, street intersections, and addresses. i prefer to use cumtd vs google maps because the cumtd website uses gps info from its buses so its times are more accurate (usually). once you learn the bus routes that are useful to you i recommended either using one of the free iphone/android apps that utilize the cumtd stopwatch. basically this allows you to plug in your stop and it will tell you which buses are arriving there and when. this is the same technology that you can also use by texting cumtd your stop number and it texts you back the bus info. to text cumtd look at the signs by the bus stops and it will give you directions.

one other thing to note is that you do not always need to show you icard to ride the bus. on the bus route signs if there is an orange ""i"" then you do not need your id. ",Comment,Positive

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign/comments/hz68w/unofficial_University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign_guide/,"concerning laptops:

i feel like this is a really important section since out of all the possible optional college investments, getting a laptop is often one of the most expensive as well as being the one people are least knowledgeable about.

unfortunately, among my fellow high school classmates going to uofi (i'm an incoming freshman), i see macbooks being the most frequently purchased. the first thing i would like to stress is that macbooks are simply not worth the price. you can get laptops for considerably lower price with similar specs with pretty much every other brand. the only thing you're getting exclusively is the operating system and some of the gimmicky programs included with the system. i can't envision a justification for spending $1500 more for an operating system. i'm unaware if any coursework outright demands a mac os program, but i'm certain there is a compatible windows 7 program for anything a mac offers. apple does have great customer service as well as a high reliability for their computers, but it simply doesn't warrant the price. with technology increasing exponentially anyways, computers are becoming outdated faster and faster.

that being said, there are still many other brands to choose from. i tend to urge people to stay away from dell, hp, and gateway as they tend to score the lowest for reliability. now i just mentioned the decreasing importance in computer reliability, but those three are notorious in malfunctioning quickly (i.e within 3 years). 

if you're just planning to use your computer for regular stuff such as surfing the net, communicating with others, etc. then i would recommend a netbook since they're cheap, generally reliable, lightweight and have good battery power. asus and toshiba both have some great netbooks.

personally, i tend to run a lot of programs and occasionally game on my computer so i have a lenovo ideapad. if you're looking for similar ""regular"" laptops, then some overall good brands to buy from would be sony, asus, toshiba, or lenovo.

but really, all i have to wish is for people to do their research before buying a laptop for college. you want to find one that fits your needs as well as your budget. the above are simply some ideas that went through my head when i went through the process of getting a laptop for college.

i will be more than happy to help anyone here that is still searching for a laptop. just drop me a message here on reddit.

* a cushion for your chair (it can be a pillow from home, doesn't have to specifically be for a chair)

* a desk light, and for that light, a blue light bulb. i know that may sound  little weird, but trust me, if either you or your roommate is going to be coming in after one of you is asleep, it is a life saver! no one gets mad because the extra bright room light is on, or that they can't see and end up tripping over everything. 

* a cheap box fan, you'll use it for the first 3 weeks and the last 3 weeks and that's it.

* mattress topper, those dorm mattresses are shit, a good night's sleep (or nap) is worth it.

* a small dry erase board, but that's mostly just for shiggles :d


things i would not recommend:

* an entirely new chair. you won't have room and the dorm chairs are fine if you throw a pillow on it.

* a floor lamp of any sort. again, no room, and a desk lamp is enough. 

* buying sheets before you get there! my parents insisted that my bed would be a ""x-long twin"" but the website lies, it's just a twin.

* a tv (your dorm friends will have one). or at least make sure you and your roommate aren't both bringing one.

after arguing about why she was right and we were in the wrong, she goes up to the board and labels the axes - the first one is y vertical, x horizontal; second one is x vertical, y horizontal.  next week, half the class dropped and went the klm route.

University of Texas Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/a3utob/how_bad_is_your_calculus_class/,"hey! i took m408d with perutz in fall 2017 and now i m in m427j with tsishchanka and i m currently signed up for m427l with an unknown professor for the upcoming semester (but might switch it with m325k: discrete math once i declare my second major of math). 

for m408d, perutz was a decent person, i guess, but he wasn t that good of a professor. in class, he would go over the theoretical stuff and proofs of calculus (since we re an  honors  class, we were supposed to go into  deeper  topics than the average m408d class so i guess that what it means according to perutz) but our homework and tests were over the practical stuff of calculus, which most calculus students would do, but the problems were literally 100x harder than calculus ab and bc problems and perutz either rushed through or didn t explain the practical stuff of calculus good enough in class. luckily, i did really well in both calculus ab and bc in high school (really good teacher and if it wasn t for m408d honors, i would have gone for m408m or m427l but it conflicted with my daily schedule though lol), so it gave me some sort of foundation to do well enough in his class. however, perutz focused so much on series and sequences, the most loathsome topic of calculus and literally 75% of his class focused on that single topic, that we rushed through multivariable calculus for the last two weeks of the semester so we didn t get a good grasp of the topic unfortunately. also, luckily though the test averages were around a c, perutz had a really nice curve so as long as you did around the average for all of your tests and depending on how you did on the hw, you can end up with a b+/a- (like you can get a b- for a regular class but end up with an a- in perutz s class-that s how generous the curve is), and i haven t heard anyone who flunked his class yet (even if they bombed the tests). i m honestly really grateful for the curve, because i did very well in the class until the middle to end of the semester (mid november-december) because of personal and family issues (so compared to my first and second midterm, my third midterm and final were not so hot), so i was able to end up with a good grade in the class even if i wasn t doing so hot near the end of the semester. 

this semester i m taking tsishchanka for m427j. for tsishchanka, you either love him or hate him depending on your learning style and personality. personally, i hate him (maybe hate is an exaggerated word, more like dislike (more accurate), but y all get my point). i like the topics of the class (i took m340l with blazek the previous semester and enjoyed it-man i miss the guy :( ), but to me, tsishchanka doesn t do a great job in explaining the topics effectively: he just pulls out the handouts of the day s topic that are posted on his website and rushes through the topic (no examples and reads off from the handout but barely), so going to class is a little pointless (in class since i have a terrible attention span that is honestly a red flag, i just scroll over my phone) though attendance is part of our grade (i just learn the topics on my own in my spare time despite taking cs439 in the same semester rn). however, what s the most annoying about tsishchanka is his freaking ego: in the first day of class, half of the class was all about him (how good of a professor he is-imo he s really not depending on one s learning style but i kind of understand the people who say otherwise-and how awesome of a mathematician) and his website (how cool of his website it is-though i adMassachusetts Institute of Technology it is because of the stuff he posts-but it s literally basic html from scratch (even a beginner programmer can design his own website no offense or anything)) and then when we got our second exams back (average was higher than usual), he then dedicated a section of the class session that day bragging about how good of a teacher/professor he is (even showcased his ratemyprofessor.com profile and the ecis survey results) which was so annoying. the good thing about his class though is that he posts the handouts and practice tests on his website so they re really good study resources for his class (esp. the exams), so as long you take advantage of those resources, you can do pretty well in the class. ;) 

so overall for both of my calculus classes, i realy loved the topics for each of the class but it s the professors themselves that ruined my opinion of the classes for me, so if i have to give a star rating for each of the classes, i would give each class a 3/5 star rating for interesting topics but below average (in teaching) professors. 

to be fairly honest, the calculus professors in ut aren t the best, but i can guarantee you that some of the probability and statistics professors at ut are worse. so, if you don t like calculus in ut, probability and statistics in ut will hit you like a truck. i took both sds321 (q-dropped it) and m362k respectively under viswanathan and (jesse) miller and they re probably the worst professors i had in ut. viswanathan is like tsishchanka, you either love her or hate her (and yes, i hated her (exaggeration but you get my point)) based on how you learn and how well of statistics you know before coming into her class (i came to her class with zero background of statistics and i hated on how rushed her lectures are and her explanations were insufficient for me) but i can understand the people who loved her though). miller was way worse-he tried implementing a socratic-style flipped classroom style so in class, he would barely lecture and if he did, it was basic stuff that you would already know and instead of teaching for the whole day, he would make us get into groups of 2-4 people and make us do problems on our own with very little help (the ta was of very little help of us); also, office hours with him was useless-ask him a question and he would reply you back with a vague explanation or question (more on the question), leaving you more confused than ever. also, his exams were ridiculous and though they re designed to make you think, the test questions were desgined very badly and a lot more difficult than the quest hw (designed to help you learn the material on your own but too easy and insufficient). however, since i had the background knowledge from sds321 (had to q-drop it since the schedule was getting too overwhelming for me and that it was not going to be useful for me if i decide to add in math as a second major), i was able to do ok in m362k (but not as good as m408d). also, i heard that miller teaches calculus as well so for anyone who has him for calculus, my sympathies to you are expanded. 

in conclusion, except for a few cases like blazek (had him for m340l-loved him and wished i had him for m427j instead-his session is before mine) and meth (who i heard is really good as well), the professors from the math department aren t the best at ut (as a computer science major at ut, the professors there, especially scott and norman, are better and miller makes novak (probably one of the utcs professors with the worst reputation) look like a virtuouso in teaching), and it s not just in calculus but in probability as well (don t know about the other sections of math though). now, end of story, and thank you for coming to my ted talk.

campus beauty: its a pretty campus with lots of wide open spaces to lay in the sunlight. word of warning: its called the 40 acres for a reason. its actually much larger than 40 acres. a bike is a great investment, but don't spend too much because it will get stolen about once a year.

quality of instruction: unparalleled. the professors are all top quality and leaders in their fields. the thing that makes ut different from other top tier universities is the dog-eat-dog nature of the classes. more than half the kids who start your program won't finish it. if you survive, you are one of the best. actively seek out and utilize resources like the free tutoring, the writing labs, and student study groups. 

likability of professors: it varies a lot. you will have a lot of professors you love. spend time in their office hours and learn as much as you can. it might pan out to a paying research position sooner than you'd think.

living in the dorms for your first year is a good idea. you'll have the opportunity to build new friend groups, you'll be closer to club meetings, you'll be more aware of campus events (fliers are posted in dorms). most importantly, it is easier to motivate yourself to go to class when you live a block away from your classroom. also, the cafeterias are really good!

public transportation: best in texas.

parking: baaaad! but you can purchase a parking spot from a developer in west campus for about 70 bucks a month or you can try to find some of the better parking/hiding spots ;)

hirability: ut has an entire department that does a great job getting employers on campus.

* parking: good luck depending on driving to campus and parking there. best to find a parking (for example, there's a church parking free for the public during the week ~38th and speedway, there's a shuttle bus across the street that brings you to campus within 3-4 minutes). overall, don't try to find parking on campus as a student. it's unreliable.
* quality of instruction: too many professors to even have a general consensus about it. try to look up your prospective professors online. it works for me, but i can tell (if that professor has a website) whether i'd like their personality or not.
* likability of professors: same as above
* ut excellent?: for me, sure, because of fafsa and that i come from in-state and its ee program is supposedly good (which to be honest, i am disappointed in). it's just filled with researchers that have outstanding cvs. ees don't have a general computer lab at all (only specific lab ones), we're stuck in one building, we have the most atrocious piss-poor undergraduate advising office you can imagine, and more. i'm pretty much shrugging off about how much i dislike even being in the ens building everyday and i don't even like studying there. i'm pretty much here because 1. i'm here already and 2. it has a good reputation which makes me wonder how the hell it even got to top 10 anyways.

* dorms. the older ones suck (jester especially, and it's the biggest), but it's the cheapest. the nicer dorms are much nicer (san jacinto for example), but they also cost quite a bit more. i suggest staying in a dorm for a year and getting to know people within your hall and making friends. make the best out of it. go to dorm meetings and get to know as many people as possible. if you're a freshman, the first month or so is pretty chill in schoolwork. use it not to just sleep and stay on the computer, but get out and socialize.",Comment,Positive

3. go to profs office. ask questions. if they are open to it, have them look at your writing drafts or ask them how to improve based on previous work. (this is especially helpful for liberal arts stuff or research papers )

another big thing that helps this place feel a little smaller is where you choose to live your first year. it may not be super glamorous to share a room or a bathroom and not have a kitchen, but living  in the dorms as a freshman allows you to make friends easily with the people on your hall through community events your ra will host, but also just because you see them so often. and it eases the transition into taking care of yourself since you don't have to worry about trying to balance cooking your first year as well.

**academics -** take time in your day to study. in your first few weeks, sit down and decide which classes will be the most difficult, reading-heavy or time-consuming and plan your schedule accordingly. reassess at midterms to see if you need to shift focus. but don't spend so much time studying that you don't have time for friends and relaxation.

if you're struggling in a class, talk to your professor or ta. most of the time, they will appreciate that you asked for help and take the time to help you understand the concepts. that's what their office hours are there for. it's also a great way to figure out if what you're studying/planning to do post-grad actually sounds appeasing.

**homesickness -** my first year, i called my mom every day. i still call her multiple times a week. i face timed my best friend when i was homesick. figure out a routine that will help you to feel less home-sick and make sure you take time to go home just because (you don't want to do this every weekend, but maybe once a month if you can).

ps. most of your classes will be large, but ugs's are a great way to pick a smaller class full of people with similar interests. there are some that only have like 20 people in them and its a requirement for most degrees (not a mccombs student so i'm not sure about that)",Comment,Neutral

also i live on campus and it's fine. i don't have a car so like walking to class is fine and its good freshman year. i can't go grocery shopping without a car so. but i have freshman friends who live off campus who like it. west campus is closer to parties and shit. on campus is good, but i never really researched into off campus, so if you think that's good for you then do it. everyone will have opinions but yours is what matters.

figured i'd reach out to ya'll since you are each knowledgeable with ut internal transfers. so it's pretty clear that i will need to maintain a 4.0 for a chance of getting into either cs or mccombs. after some research, i have discovered that i might be able to make this goal more realistic by taking some of my required classes at acc. i'd only do this for the classes that are notorious for making it extremely difficult to achieve an a. 

does anyone know if this is a possibility? i've ready about it a little, but it seems to be a gray area. is it true that cns doesn't accept some class credits from anywhere but ut? i'd take them in the summer if necessary. can i be enrolled at ut and acc at the same time? will cns or mccombs look down at classes being completed outside ut? 

thanks so much. i truly appreciate the advice.

University of Texas Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/54whml/questions_from_a_perspective_cs_student/,"what you've heard is pretty much on point. its one of the hardest majors on campus, and one of the largest. there's all sorts of people coming from all sorts of experiences when it comes to cs. don't worry if you have no experience, although it does certainly help. 

if you have ap cs credit you'll be taking 314 and 311 your freshman year, those are usually courses you'll take later in the spring semester. the greatest thing about utcs is that within your first year you'll have learned enough to be able to get an internship, the connections and opportunities here are endless. the course load is what you make it to be, i have a higher course load than others mostly cause ill be doing practice it problems and preparing ahead of time, the programs start off easily but get very hard very fast so be prepared. 

if you take 312, the intro course, be prepared to take a ugs with cline and rich. the class is very interesting and it prepares you for 311. it's just a lot of work, and practice. i do the most work for that class, you have learning modules due almost everyday and on fridays you have your discussion section where you turn in homework. 

honestly, just be yourself on your application. when i was applying i had a lot of previous cs experience. i did competitive programming in hs, interned as a web dev, and had 3 years of java experience. after getting here, what i have feels like the typical cs student coming into ut. i dont know what i had that really helped my app.


the study environment here is pretty great, if you try to study in the dorms its cold as shit so good luck. pcl is always open and has quiet and group study floors. sager learning center in jester is pretty great, you get 5 free sessions with a tutor each semester, use them cause you're paying tuition for it. also professors in all classes are usually always ready to help, along with their tas. dont be afraid to ask for help. i know acm (association of computer machinery) can hook you up with a cs tutor, but i've never really taken advantage of it. 

the building is pretty great and is one of the newest on campus. its a great place to study and relax (unless you're coding lol), and you'll be there a lot. companies come there to recruit, so always be on the lookout for free food and swag (but actually sit and listen to their pitch cause then you'll be banned from going to more recruiting events.)

as for getting in... honestly work on your essays and extracurriculars. i applied to cs with no letters of recommendation, no experience job wise, and no cs ap class (not offered). i managed to carry myself into the major entirely with those two things i mentioned. i was in three honor societies, a football captain, a member of bestbuddies (group of students helping special education students), etc. when i had to write my application essays i tied the prompt into my interest with cs. i think it was something like ""what is your future goal"", and i answered how i wanted to create my own os or shell so i could personalize my pc the way i want it. after taking os here i don't want anything to do with that, but apparently the board loved it.

4. most of the classes have weekly written assignments (if it's a theory class) or programming projects. programming is usually paced well, in that 1-2 hours of work every day will finish with some time to spare. of course you always have the ridiculously good people in every class that finish within a day ;p i don't think things are extremely, deathly difficult but for your normal utcs student they should expect to be reasonably challenged (and to rise to it).",Comment,Neutral

weather is decent except austin is the allergy capital of the world. personally i get really seriously ill in a way i didn t know was possible the last two weeks of march and the first two weeks of april from whatever pollen is around them. the summers are much more hot and humid than the bay area though and it s like a wet heat not dry heat. it gets comparably cold, it rains more in the summer than winter at least in the years i ve been here and interestingly in the summer (torrential thunderstorm rain which is really cool to watch since we seem to call a drizzle a storm in california) everything is green and in the winter everything is brown which i thought was cool because it s the opposite in the bay. 

ut s coursework is extremely rigorous no matter what your hs preparation is. you can have time for extracurricular but it will majorly pay off for you to learn what your personal liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys are so as not to burn yourself out.

the other things you ve said like research, extracurricular, etc. my personal experience has been it s not insanely competitive and people are mostly collaborative but you have to be proactive if you re not nothing s gonna happen. ut is insanely packed with opportunities and sometimes i feel like i could spend twenty years here and still not get to do everything cool is like to on campus. our opportunities are unparalleled. i d definitely say it s like the uc berkeley of texas except it s not anywhere near as crazy competitive as the horror stories you hear coming out of uc berkeley. people actually tend to have lives and good gpas imo although this is very dependent on who you spend time with. extracurriculars are what you make of them. with regard to research, i secured a position for a year basically by accident (i read about a professor in my department in a book i was reading about a semi related topic, told him i thought his work was really badass basically, and a month later he needed an assistant and emailed me and that was that).

it s my personal feeling that if you put in a modicum of effort there s no opportunity that s not achievable or attainable here. your questions seem to be angled toward is everything super competitive and overcrowded and to answer that i don t feel that it is especially compared to what i grew up hearing about college (read: uc berkeley). i feel i ve gotten opportunities/gotten to take advantage of opportunities here in austin i would not have been able to had i stayed in the bay for this part of my life because the bay is more competitive, if that helps answer your question, and that ranges from people i ve met, outside campus jobs and internships i ve gotten, opportunities in my major and outside my major, and recruiting opportunities. 

as for the city itself, someone else has said, austin is what you make it. most people who come here for school really like it, there s a good night life if that s what you re into, the river is cool, the one of my favorite things is how much music there is (i ve seen something like 80 artists in austin while i ve been here i ve literally seen every artist whose music i even vaguely like). acl and sxsw are really cool. one of the advantages of austin is everything and everyone cool is passing through there these days, everyone from cool authors, artists, musicians, even academics. coming from the bay area i did not find austin to be as fast-paced or as competitive as home.

that said, i don t actually like austin that much (some of that is bias because of poor experiences i had with school and life here but disregarding those): the infrastructure is horrible. the roads are virtually undrivable and coming from the bay it s a very very different and in my eyes much more dangerous way of driving (i drive uber as well, i ve seen some things...). be careful. secondly, if you re not into night life, well, in my opinion austin is a city that really likes to party and it s easy to feel left out in that regard sometimes. ut football is also huge here which is cool during the season i recommend participating in that culture and finding friends who do too. i don t think the food scene is as good as everyone says but again that s coming from the bay. finally, and most importantly, if you expect proper texas from austin (i was kind of hoping for it) you re going to be disappointed. austin is like the hipster parts of the bay except with a lot less diversity, smaller and with significantly worse infrastructure, and without an ocean (that said i do really enjoy the river). if you want proper texas, go to any other city in texas. i ve visited dallas (feels more corporate), houston (feels more industrial), san antonio (reminds me more of san jose and the bay area than austin does because the part of san jose i m from is relatively quiet and besides being expensive different from the stereotype of we just have hipsters running around everywhere). san antonio is one hour south, houston 2.5-3 hours east, and dallas 3-4 hrs north. i highly recommend exploring the rest of texas while you re here. these are things no one told me aboUniversity of Texas Austin that i wish that they had, hope you find them useful. 

if you do choose to go here you picked an excellent school, congratulations! i truly wish you the best here, it s an insanely awesome place to take advantage of opportunities and of all the places you could move to after the bay it s a decent choice, but for me personally moving was really hard. i hope it s better for you and you do well :).

getting to any other large texas city is veeery easy imo. the megabus station is a quick ~7 minute bus ride from campus. i use their service anytime i need to get back to my hometown.

i feel like the amount of time you have for extracurriculars depends on what type of student you are. i'm an engineering student and i personally do not feel like i have a lot of free time. last semester was extremely busy and i could barely find time for my org meetings! however, i know there are engineering majors who are capable of managing their time much better than me. for example, i know the longhorn band has a high percentage of engineerig majors and they are required to attend a 2hr practice 3 times a week + extra rehearsal before home football games and any other games inside the state + various parades + more. so with that being said, the engineers in that group definitely know how to find time for school and fun. (sorry that was a bit long haha)

i think there are plenty of opportunities for you to find friends. you could get to know people in your wing (if you choose to live in a dorm), meet people in your class, join an organization (fun or engineering related), etc. as a freshman, you're even given the chance to join a fig (freshman interest.. group? sorry i forgot). in a fig, you share the exact same classes with ~15 other people. you're able to meet people in your major and create study groups! if you attend ut, you'll definitely hear more about this during orientation.

2. austin has way more things to do than you could ever want. literally whatever you are interested in -- comedy clubs, theater, food, live music, hiking, history. 6th street and rainey are popular bar areas. there are lots of ""weird"" unique austin things as well, like barton springs, or the bats that live under the congress bridge that fly out in the thousands every night in the summer. believe me there is plenty of hustle and bustle, and you can literally walk to downtown from ut so it's not far away. i'd also recommend checking out the nature trails at shoal creek (within walking distance of ut) and the downtown austin library. there are ""megabuses"" available that can take you over the houston and dallas (both 3-4 hour drives).
3. i'd say it probably depends on your major, and your classification. as an engineering student i did feel competitive the first year or so, trying to get out of some hard basic classes. once i broke through those and had smaller, more specialized classes, i felt like students were supportive of each other and the professors all were invested in our success.
4. it depends on your work style, work ethic, and what you want to do! it's definitely reasonable to have time for extracurriculars. engineers have a reputation for being some of the busiest people on campus -- but i have engineering friends who did service, some who were in multiple clubs, some who even carried the flags at football games. actually, 70% of the marching band is engineers -- so at least all of those guys have time for extracurriculars. but really it just depends on how fast you get work done and how well you want to do in school. personally i'd recommend working extra hard the first couple of years so that you have a higher gpa going into the second half of your degree, and you'll be less stressed and can have a lot more fun as an upperclassman!
5. plenty of research going on. all you gotta do is ask around. it might be harder for a freshman to get involved, but just keep asking and you're likely to find something!
6. again, it depends on your style and your situation! some dorms are quiet, some are noisy and sociable. if you want something to do in austin, you can find something to do. and in general folks in texas have a reputation for being friendly and hospitable, so if you find people will similar interests i'm sure you'll find friends :) as far as on campus goes, there are usually sports events going on so those are fun. there are lots of restaurants on the drag (guadalupe rd) where people go to socialize right off campus. and then there is west campus too where lots of people live and where a lot of the greek life is
7. you might find it difficult to get internships as a new freshman engineer -- and a lot of your classes will be pretty large probably. but the longer you stay in the program, the smaller classes get and the easier it is to stand out and find jobs. there are lots of oppportunities to form small groups of freshman on campus also -- like figs, or study groups, or just people you meet in your apartment/dorm who want to hang out

take a 1hr pass/fail course every semester. i took weight training, ball room dance, and scuba diving my last year. it's a great way to socialize and meet other people outside your major and age group, it'll give you a designated time to not be studying or focused on engineering, and you can get into these as hobbies if you like it.

join an engineering club. i was an asme member, and there was always a meeting or seminar or guest speaker that resulted in free food and socializing. plus, you has access to the test data bank. my bil joined up swe and that was a good experience for him too, so don't think you have to be a woman engie to join up. there's also sae if you like working on cars.  idk if he's still there but matthews was a pretty cool guy.",Comment,Positive

i found the austin metro area to be very similar to the south bay, except ""trendier"".  it's like san francisco was moved to sj and rolled out to cover a larger area.

aside from the weather, the other main complaint is the traffic.  there are a lot of people in austin and it's sometimes difficult to get away from them.

other big cities?  dallas, houston, etc.... there's really no need to visit them.  anything they offer, austin will offer as well, and do it better.

if you mean general talent/participation within undergrad then the answer for civil is fairly bleak.

the civil engineering research competition only had one undergraduate participant in it. classes in the second half (the ones that are civil department specific) were generally poor in terms of quality, one class for instance had the professor just taking notes that another professor had made several years ago and pasted them in with no regard.  generally speaking, the classes that are department specific (past the second year) are ""easier"" in that the math goes down in terms of complexity, but you can expect to spend 10-20 hours a week extracting data from american sludge compliance standards manual #238, or sorting dirt types in an excel table. basically it's just menial busywork that won't really teach anything. i would say hydraulics and structural analysis are the only two upper divs that i felt meaningfully improve your ability to be a good engineer.

there are only a small handful of professors who want to do research with undergrads within civil, so i would say undergraduate research, while there, is a bit liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed.

the majority of students graduating from within civil are fairly unknowledgeable about the material  and won't make particularly great engineers in terms of technical talent. very few know basic calculus or linear algebra, and the majority try to get jobs that aren't related to engineering itself and are more management related. somewhat understandable, since the major-specific classes are generally dreadful and poorly designed, being brainless time wasters.

if you are making a choice between ut and, say, berkeley or some other top school, then i would recommend going with one of those. most of what i taught myself has been self-taught out of textbooks. i don't know if you were just asking about friendly environment, but if you want to go through a program that will make you a good engineer, then ut civil is not a good choice. i can't speak for the other programs, ece, mechanical, or other, that might have had better upper div classes or options.",Comment,Neutral

University of Texas Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/3zpmc3/any_computer_science_majors_i_have_a_few_questions/,"i did a double major in ece and cs for undergrad, so my perspective may be a bit different. i had a fair bit of programming experience before college, so i tested out of cs 312 and cs 314. also, i was able to get credit for at least 4 other cs classes through ece classes. i started the cs major in spring 2012, and i think at this point getting credit for classes (or possibly even double majoring with ece) is rare.

1. the program is rigorous, but not as difficult as some make it seem. don't get me wrong, there are some classes that seem bad at the time, but it's nothing outrageous. definitely, my most time consuming cs class was operating systems (cs 439). even then, my group realistically spent about 40 hours on each lab (you have 2-3 weeks usually), and all of us did well in the class. if you plan your schedule well, it's a reasonable class and still one of my favorites. not that you have any point of reference, but i found that my ece classes were, on average, more difficult than my cs ones.
2. i had a fair bit of programming experience before starting undergrad. my dad is an electrical engineer as well, and started teaching me java at a pretty young age. once i got to high school i used to compete in uil more or less every other weekend.
3. i took calculus bc in high school and then multivariable first semester of undergrad. calculus doesn't directly apply to most of the classes you'll take in cs, but the skills you pick up in advanced math classes are important in thinking logically and will improve your programming ability. as a side note, i've found that the most important part of undergrad is not the material, but the skills you acquire.
4. the cs program here is nationally acclaimed. once you get to the upper division classes, a substantial part of your grade comes from half-semester projects of your choosing instead of exams. professors give you a lot of flexibility in what you do for your projects as long as they can somehow be connected to the class material. this is very valuable, and something i didn't see on the ece side of things until i took graduate classes. also, the professors are pretty high caliber, so if you find yourself wanting to do research then you can find some of the experts in their fields at ut. they are also usually very open to talk with. one thing i think is worth nothing: cs is the hot new thing currently, so there are a lot of students in the major because they aren't sure what else to do. this unexpectedly saturated the classes in cs, so it has become pretty hard to get cs classes. i'm sure it's the biggest problem with the department right now, and i know some students that have had to stay an extra semester just because the class they needed was not available.
5. ut is a big recruiting school, and the career fair has an abundance of jobs available for most sides of cs. in the end, whether or not you get the job depends on how well you can come up with solutions to problems in an interview environment, but you almost certainly won't run into the problem of not being able to find jobs.",Comment,Neutral

i had programming in hs and used ap credit for cs 312

ab calculus, but at ut you'll just do calculus through sequences, series, and multivariable; linear algebra; and intro to probability and stats.

my class was one of the last before they started overadMassachusetts Institute of Technologyting and getting completely saturated so i liked the program in general but people now complain about it being impossible to transfer into and not being able to get required classes. i don't know a whole lot about the drama for the younger people but it looks pretty messy from where i'm at. main bad part to me is the social aspect, like, i meet very few cs majors who i really get along with and it never feels like anyone is really into hanging out and doing non-cs stuff, honestly i do lots of random electives to meet people i'd like more (oh yea, like girls..)

the program is hard if you are not used to churn for your own understanding. the biggest difference between ut and community college was that teachers didn't chew the information for you, so you are expected to dive into topics with you many times doing the first step after a brief almost insignificant exposure.

also, the truth is that because ut is such a large university, different functions are performed by different departments - and those departments don't always synchronize super well. it's not intended to be a scam or a bait-and-switch - it's just a lack of organization that's exacerbated by the fact that we're all working from home and super stressed out, just like everyone else.

they need to keep us updated, but there are way more things that they need to take into account that other schools don't. most of the students at ut are not from austin and a large portion are not from texas or the us. utd is primarily a commuter school. not to mention, housing costs in austin are much higher than the majority of the state. so there will be a lot of students that are upset that will need to pay large housing costs to only attend a class or two in person. also, the amount of staff ut has to other schools will play a major factor in their decisionmaking. nobody wants mass layoffs or dropouts. it's just a shitty situation all around.",Comment,Neutral

also, i honestly don't know why ut is acting like there's a good possibility it'll be safe to open campus in the fall at all. texas is spiking like crazy, especially with the lack of people taking precautions seriously + the protests have undoubtedly spread the virus further. fine, ut doesn't know *for sure* what the situation will be like in the fall, and staff are probably overwhelmed as hell, but i feel it takes some simple logic to conclude that things will only go downhill from here unless abbott actually gets serious about containing the virus (which, given his track record so far and the huge relaxation of protocol, seems unlikely.)

bottom line: i'm frustrated with the administration seemingly pussyfooting around the seriousness of the situation and pretending as if they cannot conclude that an open, fall 2020 semester will inevitably cause covid to spread like wildfire through the university population and surrounding areas. it strikes me as tone-deaf and neglectful of student needs. the university should be doing everything they can to stop otherwise preventable deaths, and dancing around the status of the fall semester + fantasizing that it will be able to keep hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals in check in regards to covid is irresponsible as hell.

both surewalk and sureride are free, the only difference is their starting times and wait times. surewalk is a ut program where qualified people will drive you back to your residence, but you ll have to wait longer if you live off campus. they usually run from 7pm or 8pm to 2am every day from what i can remember.

sureride is a ut-affiliated program: ut has partnered with lyft to assign students free ride credits for shared rides from 11pm to 4am. they can drive you back to your residence as long as it is located within certain boundaries. you can view the map here:

two things to note:

\-double majoring is ""discouraged"" because it might hinder you from graduating on time, especially if your classes don't overlap.

i have friends about to graduate with a masters's in anthropology at texas state. if you are interested in anthropology, there is a wide set of sub-fields, many of which texas state is very well respected in (more than the program at ut). that being said, the department is....difficult to deal with. not very supportive of students (in comparison to my ut graduate experience). another point to consider is that from what i've heard txstate anthropology seems to give preference to their undergrads in grad school decisions....just something to consider.

good luck! you'll make the right decision either way.

you have a valid concern about safety, but despite several very visible safety incidents during my time at ut (small female student brutally murdered on campus, knife attack that resulted in a death and several wounded), i never felt unsafe there (although i'm a male). ut started paying for lyft rides home for everyone after dark, and they always had golf carts that would take you home too. and don't take that as a bad thing either--neither of those services ever felt necessary to me. i walked home late at night a good number of times and never felt like anyone i saw was dangerous.

i didn t join ut until my sophomore year of college- it was a completely new environment, and it was... very stressful. that being said, this campus is incredibly welcoming. there are countless clubs you can join, and the people i ve met in my orgs are genuinely some of my closest friends now- i can promise you that transferring in spring will not affect your ability to meet new people and make friends. there s also groups here that specifically reach out to help freshmen and transfer students get used to the new environment. a lot of on-campus activities are held to help people socialize- they can be a little awkward sometimes, but they re still fun, and you can tell that the people running it care.

if you don t live in the dorms, it can be a bit scary walking home for the first few weeks, but as long are your aware of your surroundings, it will be alright. people have already pointed out the incidents that have happened in previous years, but i have always felt safe while on campus. if you decide to live somewhere on west campus, just be sure to walk in places where s it s well-lit. i absolutely want to echo what everyone else has been saying, and let you know that services like sure walk and sure ride are fantastic.

i m pretty small, but i ve been able to walk home at night without any incidents so far. if anything, i d advise you to be careful of the construction that seems to be constantly taking place there. it can get noisy in the mornings and afternoons, i m always having to change my walking routes to get on campus, and it makes the traffic in the area irritated and unpredictable. i ve been told that north campus is much more peaceful in comparison.

i'm actually a double major in both of these and lemme see if my input helps!

1. on the contrary to /u/bricon5's answer, i would say my ee classes have been much harder than my cs classes (but that may just be a personal thing since i enjoy coding much more and enjoy most of my coding projects not as work). in terms of similarity, the ece major can be molded into pretty much a cs major since you can take around 6 cs classes for the ee credit. i'm not so sure about the other way around. however, on the other hand, it can also be molded to the completely other direction with a heavy focus on hardware. a quick breakdown on the required courses at the bottom (regardless of which you take, there are certain classes better in each department)

2. guess i already answered that. yes.

3. i would actually recommended adding both on as a double major so you can cross enroll in classes as you wish. just get rid of one when you graduate. applying into ee is more painful than applying into cs

cs major here. i actually give tours for the cs department, and if you can swing it, i highly recommend taking one [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/undergraduate-program/admissions/schedule-visit). we can show you around the building and answer a lot of these questions.


but coming from an internet stranger lol, let me answer some of these.

1. we aren't that similar. ece isn't harder, and cs isn't harder. they are just different topics. ece will give you a bottom-up approach to computing. you will learn how low level machine languages work, then how computer architecture works, and then once you get to your upper level track stuff you can take software classes. you will have internships at places like dell, national instruments, amd, intel, etc. they will focus on lower level software like compilers, maybe operating systems, etc. eventually, if you want to, you could even end up doing higher level software stuff!. in cs, we take a slightly different approach. you start off in java, learning all your data structures and such. only after you've completed basic high level programming courses will you delve into architecture and operating systems. our typical cs internship line up could look like ... a front end developer at facebook, maps ios intern at google (me), framework internship at apple, web development intern at a start up... etc.  also, there are lots of different paths in both majors, so don't take everything i say as the gospel. but these are just paths i know anecdotally. the main difference is not the workload, but what courses and paths you take during school.

2. yes! i don't know that much about it, (cs major), but yeah, to fulfill your software reqs you can take a few. i guess a good way of looking at this would be to say... ""what do i want to do in a job/after school"". if hardware is more your fancy, ece. cs barely touches the surface of hardware, and i don't see that changing. cs is higher level stuff - for example, i do my research in machine learning and natural language processing. interships i've had are on the video/audio applications team at apple, and maps ios at google. ece is much lower level.

3. honestly, not that hard, but a pain in the ass. they've added a lot more paperwork and such, plus you can no longer switch at orientation (aka you might not get the classes you want). but other than that, you'll get in.

University of Texas Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/222ccn/ece_or_cs/,"this all depends on what you want to do. i am assuming you enjoy programming if you are interested in cs as well. ece does provide a software engineering route that involves programming as well. ece focuses more on software development and the flow of creating software through the beginning phase to development and the mechanics of refactoring code and software testing  (essentially, designing and implementing large software systems). cs focuses more on mathematics and algorithms and many types of languages (way more than ece) and the theory behind large designs of software and hardware.

there's like 500+ different student orgs on campus, go and become involved in some of them. if for some reason you can't find one that caters towards your interest/passion/hobby, go start it! being part of a student organization is a fun way to meet people of similar background or interests. 


* **parking**

it's a pain in the ass, unless you want to spend a lot of money for a garage parking perMassachusetts Institute of Technology. if you live on campus, you can get a c perMassachusetts Institute of Technology and park your car far away and use it on weekends. if you live off campus, it is usually easier to take the shuttle to commute to school. i do recommend getting the n+ perMassachusetts Institute of Technology; for $60 you can park on campus and in the parking garages in the evening/weekends. really useful if you see yourself returning to campus to workout/meetings/group projects. 


* **things to do on campus**

the university of texas houses like 4 or 5 different museums and is host to musicals, plays, and a bunch of other performances. best of all, a lot of the events are either free or heavily discounted to students! sometimes you'll have to look harder to find out about these events, but here is a good place to [start.](http://texasperformingarts.org/students)



* **classes**

let's get the first thing out of the way: **go to class**. i know it's tempting to skip, but you're paying tuition for all this, way waste the money? try to go visit your professors during office hours, most of them are really welcoming and would love to know their students better. 

you may or may not need that $300 textbook. wait till the first day of class and ask the professor if it is mandatory. some professors provide their own material and the textbook is just supplementary. 

oh yeah, join/make facebook groups for your class and invite all your classmates. this shit is so useful. you share notes, organize study groups and if you are lucky, find old tests there. ",Comment,Positive
University of Texas Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1cvxr4/advice_for_incoming_freshman_regarding_life_at_ut/,"i disagree with you (ish) on a couple of points: 

* if you're into the greek thing, go for it. lots of people love it, don't let the conforMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy scare you off if that's your thing. you will have things to do without having to try very hard. it depends on what you join, too. some are crazier/meaner/more clone-like than others.
*  live on-campus the first year, but be careful about signing up to live with people you've only known for a few months! you don't *really* know them. this is why i chose 2 years on campus (among the other reasons). the people i would have ended up living with had i signed a lease in the fall turned out to be terrible people. i'm so glad i waited until i knew people better to find roommates. 

also,

* join *something*. major-specific org, comMassachusetts Institute of Technologytees with the union, random clubs, something. you'll have things to do, a way to meet people, and something to add to a resume. i actually advise to join as many things as you can handle, but at least one. trust me.

* how to spot a greek (or, why do all these people look the same?)

>>* girls: oversize t-shirt, often pastel or neon, from an event of their sorority or a related frat. nike shorts. sperry's or tennis shoes. hair down or ponytail. occasional baseball cap. pearl earrings. hours of makeup.

>>* guys: pastel polo-style shirt. chubbies or jeans with belt. occasionally tucked in. boots or sperry's. backwards or forwards baseball cap.


i knew absolutely nothing about greek anything when i came here, and that was definitely the biggest shock for me. i didn't know about rush (all the girls have to go to a week of events for all the sororities they're rushing, and they have strict dress codes, etc for judging. but they can't carry purses - designer labels=prejudice! -  so they all walk around with ziploc bags instead. it's bizarre.) the sororities/fraternities exchange shirts, too, so don't get confused when guys wear shirts with sorority letters on it and vice versa. also, non-frat guys will sometimes wear them too. it gets confusing. 


ou weekend and acl are big deals, but in my experience, freshmen don't typically go to the ou game (in dallas). lots still go to acl, which is awesome! same for sxsw, though: fewer freshmen/sophomores because the under-21 thing is a hindrance. 


another thing: don't let people pressure you into anything. i had a whole group of people who were super into the outdoors, working out, being active - not my scene, but i felt like i was ""supposed"" to be into that since i was in austin, outdoorsy-ness is a big thing, freshmen 15, yadda yadda. it was a miserable semester of not doing what i really wanted, which was dumb. i found other friends that worked a lot better for me. same applies if you are into that but initially get lumped with people into the music scene, the art scene, whatever. just move along - no one is offended, and others will accept you! there's no time liMassachusetts Institute of Technology.

big advice: branch out! don't just hang out with the 5 people who came here from your high school (or 7 bajillion - i'm looking at you, plano). meet new people and get out there. you'll still have them as friends, and you can expand your circle! or have more than one circle. don't get intimidated and cling to what you know.

also, dorm food is not that bad, but be ready to eat pizza or burgers if the main dishes aren't to your liking. vegetarian options are okayish. special diet options are even less so, from my perspective of a non-special diet person.

take it easy your first semester. don't sign up for a ton of classes. your first semester is about figuring out 'how to college' as my friend puts it. if you are struggling with class and then are on your own and haven't figured that out, you're in for trouble. you have time to take more classes later. there's also online classes and austin community colleges that overlap with ut core classes in particular. double majoring is okay, but be sure you have a reason for it. speaking as a double major, i don't get to take as many non-major electives, which kinda sucks. but i want to go to grad school in physics and want a cs background, so it's tough luck for me. other major combos are more doable. just be sure you cab justify the extra work and potential extra expense. if you need an extra year but you're doing awesome things, don't worry too much about it.

get involved in research! this applies largely in science and engineering, bit it's true in other fields too. in fact, my favorite project in my research methods class was a humanities paper where i looked into a particular book at the harry ransom center. made me appreciate real research even more. for the college of natural sciences, check out the freshman research initiative.

i know little about the greek organizations on campus, so i'm not the authority to ask. but for the sake of comprehensiveness, i'll say something about them, although i am a bit biased.

they've always sorta struck a dissonant chord of conforMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy with me. individualism and genuine personality has always been an attractive quality in my friends. the most admirable men and women that i know have declined invitations to fraternities and sororities and consequently are more likely to form the center of their own intimate social circles. their friends are usually of the more loyal and willing caliber, and will likely trek across campus to come visit them for help if not solely for the company.

the company that more personable and aggressively idealistic individuals inspire is more attuned to their interests, varied in their capabilities, and collectively welcoming of new people (and therefore, always growing). they make college memorable, safer, and worthwhile.

*as a sidenote*:

i actually once knew a girl who had lived in a sorority with 50 other girls and moved out to live in a house just north of campus. a typical sorority of ever-fawning and perky freshman girls. my friend had said that her experiences met her expectations of the lifestyle, but it 1) got old quickly, and 2) was not what she wanted her college days to be summed up by. upon revisiting her old sorority class the next year, she not only couldn't remember any of their names, but she realized that she didn't actually *know* any of them. i can't imagine how many of the others girls wore practiced smiles thinking the same.

for example, when was the last time there was a strike of ut faculty or staff?

how many people who work at ut are even union members?

University of Texas Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/xyifd4/how_not_to_be_extremely_miserable_at_ut/,"looking at your other posts, i think you might just be happier transferring. 

correct me if i'm wrong, but it seems like you already started off with the wrong mindset. you were already thinking of leaving before you even started. if you'd already dismissed it, it's really hard to fix, and anything negative you feel will be intensified. 

on a lighter note, it's only been a little over a month and you're a freshman. everything going on right now is pretty normal, regardless of where you go. finding the right people to make friends takes time, especially when college is a lot more diverse than high school, and honestly, i don't think most people become friends with their roommates unless they're lucky. 

my advice? first, know it's okay and normal, it's a huge and difficult change for a lot of people and you certainly aren't alone in your feelings. secondly, if you want to get more involved, check out what events are happening via hornslink and try going to some, even if you're alone, but don't be too hung up on it either.

i managed to get lost at my tiny school too. i hated the weather (snow is not my friend and i lived in a ski town). my roommate threatened me with bodily harm (i wish they had acted like i didn t exist). i didn t really stand out in class or go to parties or anything. i just wanted to go home, and i was supposed to be having the time of my life. 

so, this kind of experience can happen anywhere, and it can be a long term project to figure out who you are and what you want. once you know that, you ll know where to go, find folks who share those interests, etc. but that s long term existential work and it takes time, and that s ok. 

so for now, you re in a huge place with people who like all kinds of things. i d start by jotting down things you currently or previously enjoyed. do you like to bake? do you unwind by playing league of legends? do you like to draw? did you play a sport in high school? do you follow a particular spiritual or faith tradition? is there a random thing you ve never done but you think it looks cool? there s probably a group, club, or org for that. if you like your major, you can always jump into an org connected to it as well to start meeting more people interested in studying the same things. you might check the student involvement web site and start to narrow things down by interest to cut through the overwhelming amount of options.

campus feels really big at first, but once you get used to it and shortcuts. i lived in creekside last year, which was a nice 10 minute walk uphill to both dining halls, so i got used to walking around a lot. i'd recommend just walking around and exploring, (you can get pretty much anywhere on campus that you're not supposed to be if you try hard enough lol). 

the weather gets better in a month or so. i am from new england. trust me, like up to november-ish the heat is god awful, but it'll cool down enough to be comfortable soon. you'll also eventually just get used to it. it's an odd feeling going home in summer and being cold in 70 degrees, when that was a bit hot for the entire rest of my life.

the closest person my age that i knew before getting here lived in colorado, so entered knowing nobody. i'm a super shy person, so i found it really hard to meet people at first, but i'd recommend just finding someone who looks like they'd be down to talk and just start talking, see if they want to hang out sometime. try to find a mutual interest that you can bond over, could be an activity, show, or even just a class. though, the majority of my friends here i've made though one mutual friend who just didn't leave me alone, so you could always try that ig.

for clubs, just look up some interesting ones and go to a couple meetings. ut has a list of every affiliated club somewhere on their website. personally, i'm not big into orgs, but i can see the appeal. 

i'm not too good in roommate advice, bc i typically don't want to bother anybody, and try to stay out of the way, basically ignoring them. try to make friends with them, find reasons to hang out. if they still want to keep a distance, that's alright too. you don't need to be super close with your roommate or anything, just try to stay friendly lol.

i entered ut thinking i would have 0 friends, but my senior year habits transferred over and they were stronger. i talk to everyone who sits next to me, and if i like them, i ask for their instagram, try to say hi next time i see them. i ve been given a few dirty looks, but you know what? i don t care. ut is giant, and who gives a fuck what people have to think or say. just put yourself out there, have a sense of boundaries, and talk to people!! i know it sounds hard, but you have to push yourself out of your comfort zone. i would also recommend making friends within your major, bc you ll see those people more often!

everyone living in any city (or really, anywhere) should be aware of their surroundings and exercise caution and common sense, of course. and ut has great programs that other commenters have already mentioned to assist with that. after living here for several years and having lived in other cities as well, anyone saying austin is inherently unsafe has never spent meaningful time somewhere that's legitimately dangerous. and if austin were that bad, people probably wouldn't keep flooding in here in spite of things like the high cost of housing.

once on campus, a guy asked what (cs) threads i was and then said  oh yeah, the girl threads.  luckily though, a (male) friend of mine who was there pulled him aside later and explained to him (1 on 1 so he wouldn t be defensive) that what he said was sexist, mean, and wrong. he then apologized to me and adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted what he said was wrong. *i really appreciated that, and would highly suggest this method to any male allies!!*

i ve had a very uncomfortable experience with a former coc ta. he asked me to hang out with him repeatedly and i declined every time. (being vague to preserve anonyMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy) he then did something to scare me that made me extremely uncomfortable and anxious. i reported it to gtpd saying i didn t want to press charges unless he had been reported before. gtpd was great about taking my statement and offered to bring in someone from voice. before this, i d considered being a ta at some point. but after that experience, i couldn t imagine being in office hours at a scheduled time or being unable to avoid (if it came to it) other students who might sexually harass or stalk me. 

i ve also had a close friend (who i d known over 2 years) insist repeatedly to come over when i was feeling sad and really down. although i wanted some alone time, i gave in and figured seeing a friend might help cheer me up. it wasn t unusual for us to sit side by side on my bed and talk. but that time was different. after a bit he put his arm around me and then laid down. after encouraging him to leave and insisting that i was tired and needed rest, he tried to sleep over. in my bed. keep in mind, i was sad about some boy trouble and this friend had never crossed any boundaries before, so all of this was really new and unexpected. we aren t friends anymore. friends don t cross boundaries when you re sad and vulnerable. 

all of this to say, i hope sharing my experiences can help other women know they re not alone. and to any allies reading this, please please please step in when you can. tell that asshole in the group project that he keeps interrupting your teammates and ask them what they have to say. tell that friend of yours that he crossed a line and that what he did or said wasn t okay. and be aware of any biases you might have in the way you talk about women, talk to women, or treat women.",Comment,Neutral

groups where i have been the only female have almost always been a terrible experience. some guys would always feel the need to explain things to me and only me even when i fully understood the concept.

i have a couple stories that might be similar as well. you're definitely not alone.

i was walking to class from west campus and there was a housing maintenance van parked outside on the road. there was a man inside and he suddenly cat called me as i walked by. i had never been cat called before and i felt disgusting. maintenance at tech housing sucks but i didn't know they also had horrible personalities if they're going to cat call students.  i was wearing a t-shirt and jeans. 

another time was with another student. i lived in woodruff with other transfer students and one of my friends apparently had a crush on me, which i was oblivious to. he saw me walking from willage back to woodruff so we walked in together and in the elevator, he cornered me and towered over me and just started smiling. if the elevator hadn't opened i would have pepper sprayed him right there but i was frozen. now i usually don't interact with anyone unless it's in a class. i am in one club with a majority of males but i've managed to become president and everyone in the club is a good friend of mine now and they're all very kind.

i had a groupmate that literally asked out my friend after our first meeting (which was basically just introductions and contact info exchange) and tried to invite her over for dinner. when she said no and said she was a lesbian and not interested, he invited her again under the premise of just doing it as a practice for him. she said no again and yet he continued to lust after her the duration of the project and flirt and make moves. again, he did not know her beyond just a  hey my name is..  so it was just odd for him to have formed such a fixation so early on so it was 100% just based on her looks and his imagination & fantasy. it was so cringey and disappointing and discouraging to see him treat her as a projection for his fantasy and not like an equal partner in the project. we are not here and paying thousands of dollars to date you or find a husband or booty call, we are here to do amazing in our classes and projects and get our degree.",Comment,Neutral

it's terrible to think it only really takes 1 person in your work environment to cause waves. i don't think this issue is going away as the 'old guard' of engineers retire. instead, the issue is evolving. instead of being undervalued and seen as a fake engineer, the industry now uses us as a token piece, 

be aware that now engineering companies will force women and minorities into leadership roles earlier than they should be because they want the 'we have x percent of women in technical leadership . this leads to female engineers not having time to build their technical skills and forced more and more into the 'powerpoints and soft skills realm'. nothing wrong with this move, but if done earlier than you want,  it will force your career path in the future. 

at the end of the day, i have hope that the world of engineering (in industry and college) will get better for the pure reason that women are more and more aware. we are so lucky to have women that have those rare women that have been industry 10-20 years longer then us that help us find our path, earn our stripes, and just be a hell of an engineer.  good luck and find a company that treats you as a great engineer you are, not a great female engineer.",Comment,Neutral

i've also experienced some things that made my blood boil.

some ta's would, instead of helping, just give me the answer on a hw etc, while when my male peers would go to the same ta, they wouldn't give any answers and give some small hints. this helped short term, but didn't give me the best chance for me to learn.

some of my male peers also ""mansplain"" or talk over me.. i'm not sure if some do it on purpose but either way, it's annoying and exhausting having to tell them you know in a nice way (or just bear to listen) or continue to talk.. they also seem to take the ""harder"" problems without giving me a chance to take the assignment.. or just take it without saying anything.

when i act confident, i'm told i act ""bitchy"" from male peers.

i've been told multiple times i don't belong here or that i only got here because i'm a girl.

it sucks that a lot of stem programs have a small ratio of women, which doesn't help. it doesn't help that some peers have some kind of god complex against other universities/majors.

i often struggle in some classes because i'm like one of the four girls in the class and constantly feel like i need to prove myself to other people.

though this isn't just a problem here, it has happened everywhere..

sometimes men won't look into my eye and when giving them a handshake, their hands are limp.. 

i've been told growing up i'd be a good ""house wife""..

one of my high school teachers have picked on females throughout the semester, and at one point, one teacher had told a girl to ""let a man answer it"".

at young ages (12-16), i've been cat called by older men, which i thought was absolutely disgusting for them to hit on underage girls.. 

regarding video games, i've always been told that it isn't a girls thing... by my parents and friends. when asked what video games i play, they assume phone games or a more ""girly"" video game.. which are perfectly fine, but let women play what they want without the unnecessary stereotypes. i unfortunately have to stay away from voice chat with people and play with friends i know to not get harassed online  . once someone online knows i'm female, some men will over critique how i play or try to give me help/advice when i didn't ask for it. i've even been told by a peer that men are more genetically gifted at video games than women because men were the hunters in hunter gatherer societies.. like okay? that doesn't apply to all video games anyway.. i'm just trying to enjoy my time lol.

edit to add: my wife also reminded me that it wasn't any better after school. she worked on a helicopter flight line and had numerous incidents that were both demeaning and threatening. she broke one guy's nose when he tried assaulting her in an aircraft hangar, and he was fired for that incident. the japanese engineers she was supposed to interface with from the company supplying the transmission for the helicopter she was designing wouldn't even acknowledge her existence until she got up in their faces and yelled at them. the chief engineer for the fuselage supplier told her ""don't worry your pretty little head about that"", and the vp and project lead in that meeting had to pry his tie out of her hands after she pulled him across the conference table with it. she took a great helicopter anti-torque concept and made it commercially viable with some tweaks to the design and got absolutely no recognition for what she did because, as she says, ""i don't have a pair of balls"".

Georgia Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia Institute of Technology/comments/mf20ds/being_a_girl_at_this_institute/,"i know this thread is older, but i remembered a couple of experiences i wanted to share.

1. i mentioned this in a comment, but i'll mention here too. my first year, i was at a religious service with a group from gt (being vague for anonyMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy but this was pre-covid) and i had my guy friend with me. it was family weekend. one of the guys after the service started hitting on me, standing really close to me (i have ptsd, and that's a big no-go for me), and basically backing me into a wall. his parents then realised what was going on, and this guy straight up asked him parents if they could make me date him and they did try. i had to lie and say that the guy friend i brought with me was a boyfriend just to get them to leave me alone. whenever i see this guy around campus, he asks me how my ""boyfriend"" is doing.
2. i was in culc on a friday waiting for my friends (again pre-covid) and was watching a youtube video. i got the feeling someone was watching me, and it wouldn't go away, even when i moved seats or went to the restroom and returned. i looked up at one point and made eye contact with a guy staring me down from across the room. he then came over, told me i looked so pretty in my dress, and wanted to know what i was laughing at since laughing made me look even prettier. noped the fuck out of that one.
3. this happened last semester. my third year. i was in a psych/cs class and we were assigned groups. mine was a group of 3, two girls (including me) and a guy. the other girl and i were on the same page for most of the project, but even when we weren't on the same page, we were at least in the same book. the guy, on the other hand, talked down to both of us, didn't listen to us, try to do his own thing for most of the project, deleted hours worth of my work because he ""didn't like how it looked"" (these were sticky notes, we weren't being graded on presentation of the notes) before overwriting the file, and his parts of the project were always half-assed or unfinished, and then he'd complain that we girls were the problem and that we didn't know how to even do this project. we were using my concept/idea and the other girl's design.

this school pisses me so much at times. i am scared to go anywhere alone, and i refuse to walk to some areas without my guy friends. i'm put down for my sex, i'm told i'm too stupid, or that i used my ""feminine wares"" to get in (i'm not conventionally attractive imo and i'm about as flat as they come). i do not feel safe on campus, and the ptsd makes everything so much harder because of the hypervigilance and the exaggerated startle response. i started taking martial arts at tech (pre-covid) just so i could feel safer walking back to my dorm at night. there aren't enough lights on campus, too many dark areas for people to hide in.

one thing i want you to know is that the people that try to degrade you by saying that you only got into tech because you're a girl are literally just projecting their insecurities and lack of self-worth at you. do not listen to these people. these are the same types of people that will use gender (or even race for that matter) as an excuse when they receive any form of rejection like so:

""ah i obviously didn't get that job because all the company needs to fill in their gender quotas.""

""well the reason why she got an interview was probably because she's a girl""

stuff like this is just an attempt at pointing the finger at other people to cover up their own failures rather than looking within themselves to see how they could improve or work harder the next time to achieve success. it has nothing to do with your abilities and it has everything to do with their lack of them.

to all the women that were told that they got into this school because of some gender quotas, you belong here because you're a capable, smart, and dedicated future engineer and not because you're a girl. and next time when someone says this to you again please kindly tell this person to go fuck themselves.",Comment,Neutral

a few things that have helped me:  i've looked into professional organizations for women in industry and attended their events and virtual meet-and-greets.  additionally, i find female role models, through older classmates, professors or grad students that i look up to, or women in leadership in my internships.  i've also started listening to podcasts about women in stem - specifically, [double shelix](https://www.doubleshelix.com/) and [women in tech with ariana](https://www.wallwaytech.com/podcast).  there is an excellent [article](https://hbr.org/1995/09/the-power-of-talk-who-gets-heard-and-why) about how linguistic differences in men and women affect how we perceive each other in the workplace.  it's very insightful.",Comment,Neutral

the prof that got to me the most was constantly bringing up gender in class. his comment i still remember the most was about how the females in the class don t participate enough and seeing as how participation was part of our grade he then required the rest of the questions for the semester be answered alternatively by males and females. this in a class with two women now responsible for answering 50% of his questions every lecture. plenty of guys sat silently in that room all semester as apparently the prof could tell most of them apart from each other since they weren t women. it truly demonstrated how much harder we had to work to prove to him that we deserved to be in his class. 

another prof didn t want to write me a letter of recommendation but then said that since i got an a in his class he guessed he had to write it.

as a female, you're in a different boat than i am. i've met guys that don't seem to realize that women are people (i guess they never had sisters or mothers). but as a human being, i can tell you that being who you are is so much better than trying to be who you think people will like. you'll meet a lot of people who don't care to get to know you, but eventually you'll find people who like you for who you are. with the dating scene, you'll eventually find someone who you like who isn't intimidated by your intellect; it might just take a little longer. but my whole block of text can be summarized by: from personal experience i can tell you that being yourself is leagues better than pretending to be who you're not. to hell with the kids who get intimidated by intellect. 

~~side note: don't know if this'll actually work, but if someone catcalls you or harasses you, you should stop and look straight at them with a face of pity with a hint of disgust and say ""kid, that's kinda cringe."" it's humiliating especially if there's others around. it gives them that feeling that you get when you try a new joke in a crowd and it falls flat. it works on me and it works for me in a plethora of situations.~~

guys treating you like you are dumb and saying you don't belong at tech are both obvious cases of sexism. it is wrong.

however, i see the dating situations as irrelevant to any gender issues. those sound more like personal issues of self-respect. you can't expect to find someone you like by not being yourself. if you are dating someone who disrespects you, that is when you break up. whether they are a guy or girl, they are a bad person.

as for the study sessions and flirting, i just think that is how guys are. it wouldn't fly in a strictly professional workplace, but that is not what tech is. it is a college campus, and anyone can do anything they want. would a group of girls invite a guy to a study session? no.

the rest is actually wrong of those people. while the professor's compliment is not exactly inappropriate, it is still a little weird, and i wouldn't like it either. obviously, the harassment is a serious problem, but nobody, regardless of gender, should be out at night.

\> more on the professors- maybe it's just me, but a lot of them need a course on mental health. not the, ""these are the warning signs of depression"" or ""this is how you spot a suicidal student"" classes, but the ""making all of your students think they're failing until the end of the semester and then curving the class at the end isn't cool"" course. having a student go months on end working their ass off, stressing out, thinking that they're failing a class, and then you magically swooping in and ""making it work out"" in the end is not okay. i'm tired of being stressed all semester thinking i'm going to barely get a c in a class, only to pull out a b because you curve the class by 15 points. put in the effort to make your exams accurately reflect the knowledge a person should have. if a person fails an exam, it should be because they failed to learn the material, not because the average was a 52, so really, they did better than a majority of the class. **i'm tired of seeing my classmates as competitors. i'm in a class right now where an a is awarded to the top 20% of the class. i'm sure you'll be \~shocked\~ to know that a majority of piazza questions go unanswered because no one wants to help anyone get a better grade. everyone is secretly hoping that everyone else does poorly, so they can look better**. i get that this is how it is in the real world, but at least in the real world, you have allies. you have a department to work with or an it guy to help you. here, you're in a massive lecture hall with no it guy to joke with or janice from hr to get lunch with. you're by yourself and there's no one leaving cake in the break room. personally, my gpa doesn't define me, but it does define the tens of thousands of dollars in tuition scholarship that i get, and without it, i can't go to school here. so don't tell me that i shouldn't stress about the grade to begin with. 

there is a lot in here that i want to process and don't feel i can do it in one response.  there isn't anything you said that i disagree with but i want to talk about the part i highlighted. many faculty (gt is >50% full professor) came of age where grading on a 'bell curve' or pre-defining a grade distribution was the norm. frankly, it no longer should be - it is out of line with modern educational practice. it is also more often than not a cover for poor instructional practices. most faculty at gt are not promoted/rewarded for their education prowess, they may be lauded for it but they are not rewarded for it. that is the nature of a modern research institution. whether that should or shouldn't be is off topic to this post though.

however, there are things you can do. in the end, gt does have the ability to define what a grade is. the university policy is here: [http://catalog.Georgia Institute of Technology.edu/rules/5/](http://catalog.Georgia Institute of Technology.edu/rules/5/). i would encourage students to work with sga to advocate for changes in that policy that you think are more fair and reasonable. you could make it explicit that grades are absolute (i.e., based on individual performance against an equal standard) and that a 'bell curve' approach where grades are assigned based on relative-performance is not acceptable. don't rely on faculty to change on their own, force gt to fix things that need to be fixed. they are hesitant because they don't want to intrude on 'faculty freedom.' however, when faculty being free to act a fool interferes with students rights and fair treatment they should and already do (e.g., a faculty member cannot unilaterally penalize you because they think you comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted academic misconduct).

separately, it may seem hard to believe, but most of the faculty do really care about the students. some of them are just really bad at articulating or showing it - not an excuse just an observation. some of them feel that assigning grades on a relative curve is actually pro-student, because it helps you know your performance relative to peers and motivates. as wrong as that may be, it is well intended (and yes, i know that doesn't help much). that doesn't change what you experience, but i'm hoping it might change your framing a bit - an assumption of malice only multiplies the feelings.

also agree with what you said about professors. additionally, tech needs to address the abysmal teaching skills that most professors possess. many of my professors have made it patently obvious that their research comes first and teaching is an unfortunate stipulation to that. they are unprepared, talk to the whiteboard in a monotone, spiral into tangents, and present material in the most bland way possible. some of the best professors i've had are actually lecturers, so their primary job is to teach and they are much better at it! as a student, i am happier in classes where i am actually engaged and excited about the material, rather than suffering through a dull class because it's a requirement.

college is the easiest time in your life to meet other people, freshman year especially. unless you're a social butterfly it's tough to befriend peers in lecture. i barely met anyone in lecture or recitation. joining clubs was the key to me making any friends outside of class. after college it gets a lot harder to make friends...many of my classmates that have graduated and moved to new cities (even the most extroverted) ones always bring up when we catch up ""man it's hard to make friends as an adult"". and tbh the solution now is still the same: join clubs, get involved. well now they're like office kickball leagues and not as cool as some of the common interest clubs available at gt.

yes the professors do suck and i barely learned anything from my clearly research focused professors. but the isolation from lecture sizes can't be blamed, every other big school has that. the big culprits are combatting students with set percentiles for letter grades is archaic and stressful as fuck. also seemingly being at the will of your professor's arbitrary grade curves that you only find out about at the end of the year.",Comment,Neutral

1) the gpas and retention rates back then were both much lower. sounds to me from your description that profs basically just curve more now than they used to, but i'm not even clear about that, because i've literally gotten an 18% as my final grade and had that curved to a b. in the 90s, average gpa was like a 2.4 and a third of people adMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted failed out.

2) the admin back then didn't pretend they weren't doing it. they'd say basically, *""yeah, we could teach you all this material and make it much easier, and you'd still learn it, but we're not going to do that. we make it hard on purpose. the goal is not to learn engineering scholarship, the goal is to mold you into an engineer.""*

and i think there was a lot more honesty in #2, because trust me, engineering jobs suck. they are very unfun. the stress is high, the expectations are often outrageous, and the best employees are ones who can pin their ears back, swim through the stress like a duck in water, and deliver a good product in the face of those ridiculous expectations. gt had a reputation back then for not just teaching engineering, but building *engineers*.

some profs want to challenge you. i agree its unfair to keep students in the dark about how well they are doing, and its stressful. to this, there's the canvas feature that shows how well you do with respect to other people. some profs in the past would announce approximately what the a,b, c cutoffs were (ie avg = 55 , a = 60, b = 50, etc).

for housing, i live on campus, and i like the housing system. a 2:1 person:bathroom ratio is more than i could have asked for. you're taking for granted that you have your own private bedroom, which is not necessarily the case. some of my friends (4 of them) that do not attend tech live in a 400sqft ish room. they have a single bathroom/sink, and no kitchen. its basically just a large room with 4 beds that are about 5 feet apart. i think its normal to not have a private room, and i am grateful that tech has enough housing for all its undergraduates. water is always hot and available, theres no problems with electricity or other amenities, and internet is basically the fastest available unless you want to drop $100 on a 10 gbps ethernet expansion card.

as a cs major, i particularly understand the struggles of being in large lectures of (100-250) people classes all the time.  it's the worst. nobody knows when you go to class and when you don't, and the only interaction you can really have with the ""faculty"" is the through the tas. but i do not come to gt to learn all the material from and interact with other students who know maybe a semester or 2 more than me of the material.

more professors and smaller classes are a must. out of curiosity, what is the smallest cs class other people have been in? i can only think of junior design, which has 35 people, but other than that, cs classes have all had 100+ people.

last year, fall 2017, i started as a freshman me and of course i was initially super excited and proud that i had made it into tech from a very small school where my graduating class had 88 people, most of whom went to community colleges. almost as soon as i got onto campus, even i m in facet i began to realize how competitive and isolating it is to be on campus for lots of people.
in terms of classes, i only had one actual class that i enjoyed my first semester which was me 1770, which was a very small classroom where my professor actually cared for her students. other than that i was extremely isolated in large lectures and i was struggling horribly with mental health issues. 
i went to the counseling center and, in no fault of the faculty there, i was not able to be seen for 3 weeks. once i did start at the counseling center all of the faculty was great but it was obvious that they were just not able to give the level of one-on-one personal care that many people need and they offered tons of  group therapy.  and while this may work for people who realized their issues early enough, it almost never helps people who are truly in a bad place. i was never once referred to the campus psychiatrist, even though i was not making much progress with traditional counseling. hell i didn t even know that there was a psychiatrist on campus until i did lots of digging online. 
in my spring semester my situation only got worse and i ended up petitioning and being granted a medical withdrawal from the entirety of spring 2018. i originally planned to take the summer off and return in the fall, but since the antidepressants i initially tried were either not helping or actually making it worse i decided to take fall 2018 as a gap semester to help myself. after lots of thinking i decided that tech was not the place that i could be and i will not be returning to tech to finish my degree. the campus environment is too competitive, toxic, and seems to have little care for students and all of the  academic help  programs felt to me like they were only offered because they had to be offered and there was little to no sincerity or actual help being offered. 
all of this being said, i am still proud that i was able to get into a top tier school like tech, and i admire those who  make it out , but it is not an environment or school that i want to be a part of anymore. luckily i do still plan on getting my degree from another top tier public school, but it has taken me a long time to get here and i m still going through hoops to get there.",Comment,Neutral

i really appreciate that you made your post about something other than suicide/depression, while giving it a nod while starting out, plus also capping your post off with a mention of your personal struggles.  yes, that subject area is extremely important, but those discussions unfortunately crowd out other valid subjects most of the time.

however, i feel the ""housing here sucks"" portion is overblown.  students nowadays have more options than ever, and complaining about housing strikes me as whining based on folks' standards being too high.  transportation might suck (and yes, i've read plenty of posts about it here), but on-campus housing isn't further apart than it was in the '80s and the stinger didn't run in the evenings/nights back then.  don't take this as an ""i walked to school both ways uphill in snow"" kind of post, just as a suggestion that one should simply deal and not obsess about certain things.",Comment,Neutral

* i've always sat in large lecture halls with my friends, which is fun. i made a large effort to make cs friends shared my passions for the subject freshman year by talking to as many people as i could in ai club (the agency), hanging around the coc (not good unless you already know some people), and eating in dining halls with my majority-cs freshman squad. since then, i've known people in all my cs classes, and i try to study with and around them as much as they let me. i know a lot of people don't study well without isolation, which sucks, but personally i find it much more enjoyable to be around people i know but can stay quiet with while studying.

* since my cs friends don't want to do much fun stuff, i've had to find fun friends. at this point, that's my fraternity.

* lower level cs class piazzas are lit. honestly, smaller classes (other than honors discrete where the freshmen all have hardcore nerdyness in common lmao) had less people talking, both in person since they had less friends in classes, and on piazza.

* most lectures i've been in are are pretty meh, from both lecturers and professors alike. hb was a bit of an exception, since she slogs so slowly through her error-filled powerpoints (which i guess have been improved, maybe?), there's no point in ever showing up. it's good to be able to learn from other resources like 2x speed videos like vigoda's algos lectures and /u/hfh and michael littman's udacity videos.

* the only cs class i've had that's really on a curve so far was ml. none of my classes have felt competitive, and ones without active piazzas felt like people were just not thinking/caring about others.

* apartment-style dorms are nice as long as you're in the majority that are renovated, but have jack shit in terms of community. i don't see this changing.

i think this is partially a remnant of the brutal culture of tech s past that other commenters have alluded to. it s amazing to see the transition that a lot of freshman go through, coming in with high ambitions, only to see that many of the upperclassmen are counting down the days to graduation. this has become a constant feedback loop that is only gradually changing.

Georgia Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia Institute of Technology/comments/231dj4/compe_and_compsci_advice/,"let me give you some industry perspective:

> i want to be competitive in getting jobs that are more software based than hardware

i'm at a small company that writes software for embedded devices. we have a hardware guy who designs the circuit boards, and the rest of our engineers write software that runs on them (as well as windows/linux/ios/android). i'm cs, but our other developers are about a 60-40 mix of compe and cs, despite the fact that we all write software (and mostly just higher-level stuff, since the lower-level code doesn't need to change that often).

my opinion is that you should do cs. if you go compe, then yes, you'll learn how to program... but you'll also learn a lot about electronics, circuits, and the internals of cpus and dsps that you won't use as a software developer.

in tech's cs program, you *will* study computer hardware. you'll be taught how cpus work internally, and you'll spend some time simulating them and even designing them at a high level. the difference between cs and compe is that once you pass that point, in cs you'll broaden yourself with exposure to other aspects of software engineering, such as multithreading, algorithms, networking, software testing, development lifecycle, etc.

as a cs major at my job, i've picked up some more bits and pieces about how hardware works. but honestly, it's mostly for my own curiosity; it's rarely necessary for my day-to-day work. i feel much better served for having studied higher-level concepts which my compe coworkers missed out on. unless you plan on designing cpus or need to know a lot about dsp, compe is not as good a fit for just writing software.

as far as class recommendations: you'll have to take cs 2110 and cs 2200, which you'll probably enjoy. after that, make sure to take cs 3210 and 4210, the operating systems classes; they are really cool, and you'll learn a lot. 3210 will have you studying linux in detail to learn how it handles various parts of the system (memory management, task scheduling, file systems), while 4210 will study oses in breadth to see different ways of abstracting the system and how oses interact with userland.",Comment,Positive

Georgia Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia Institute of Technology/comments/87fsx7/kinda_terrified_of_ga_tech_after_reading_recent/,"honestly, people come here from high school where they've been able to take 8 ap classes, do five extracurriculars, and still have time to sleep, and they think that they can keep up with it. and they can't - if you try to do some balancing act, you might be able to keep up with it for a semester or two before falling apart.

gt is a high-stress environment. it comes with being a competitive school. that, coupled with the fact that intelligent people are being genuinely tested for the first time in their lives, leads to a lot of stress and mental issues, and gt counseling isn't the best equipped to handle these issues (though there's changes on the way to that, reportedly, i think?).

if you expect to sign up for the same workload as high school and expect to put in the same amount of effort, you're going to fail, or you're going to go crazy from the effort involved to get the results you got in high school. keep it liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed, don't worry about graduating in less than four years, find one or two orgs that you can really fall in with, and prioritize sleep over everything. there's not some magical formula to not letting gt get to you, or letting gt compound off of already existing issues - you kinda have to figure out where you're comfortable.

you also need to *listen to your body and mind*. so many people push past their own liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys of stress, sleeplessness, workload, with this mentality that ""if i can survive this, i can graduate and slow down when i get a job"". but not everyone is going to survive that, and don't think that it won't be you. if you're waking up every day miserable, dreading the notion of class, too busy or swamped with work to go out and have fun, don't be afraid to make a change, and don't be afraid to slow down with your course progression. graduating in 5 years isn't as exciting as graduating in 4 years, but it's preferable to jumping off the coca cola building.",Comment,Neutral

i personally think that most of the mental breakdown issues tend to come from people who thought they could coast here like they did in hs, but then hit a wall they are unprepared for and don't know what to do or how to react. not that all of the posts/stories about mental issues/illness here come from that, but i think that's a factor in many of the issues that freshman especially experience.

what worked for me personally, was honestly lowering my expectations. my first year i was all about getting good grades, but didn't really put in the work because i didn't know what putting in the work really required. my gpa after my freshman year was a 2.5 and i'd never even made a b before coming here. i realized i had to put in more work than i was to even make a b in most of my classes. after my first year i kind of re-evaluated myself and my habits and came into my second year with a different mindset.

i try to do the best i can in my classes without sacrificing my mental health or well-being. i know if i want to be an a student here, it would require me to be working at 100% every single day and i also know that personally, i can't do that without going crazy. i'm not saying its the same way for everyone because people come through tech and make 4.0's and get out no problem. but it's just not something i personally think i can do. 

really it comes down to knowing yourself and your liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys. my gpa has gone up since i came at tech from a different approach. trying harder but expecting less did make my grades improve, but you've just got to remember to set aside time for yourself and your friends/hobbies.

manage your time, make sure to get some sleep and take time to actually eat real food from time to time, and you'll be fine.

my identity as an overachieving kid has been totally destroyed and that great because i'm looking for a new one. if i had been to a school where i could still be pretty smart, then i would be truly afraid that i would become really complacent individual devoid of a meaningful life, being happy with just being a ""smart"" kid.

a counter point from someone that graduated with ""highest honors (3.55+)"" but was dissatisfied with my grade and tech in general. it is not merely about ""don't let grades be who you are."" 

people are different. sure we all have the same generic features, but if you get satisfaction from playing guitar doesn't mean everyone has to. good for your sister if she wants to teach hindi to kids, but everyone doesn't want to. 

also, ""people liking you"" is a very shitty metric to base your self worth on. just ask all the people who were ridiculed and bullied and made fun of; ask the lgbtq community about their struggles growing up. surely by your definition these people should all be miserable because well no one liked them. i made a plenty of friends at tech, partied a bunch, was involved in stuff that i cared about, traveled extensively over the summers, interned at amazing companies that couldn't tell tech apart from gsu, and am currently working at an amazing company from skills i developed no thanks to tech. and on my worst days at tech, i had thoughts about death, and the fucking meaninglessness of life in this one tiny fucked up school in this one tiny planet in one small galaxy. 

i was a very happy person before coming to tech, and i blame tech for all the unhappiness and depression problems that i developed at this institution. if i could reverse this decision, i would have gone to other schools and taken out  loans instead of settling for tech because of cheaper tuition. in life, all things being equal, you get rewarded for the effort you put in, unless you are an outlier. at tech, that doesn't matter. it is not about deriving meaning out of your grade, but seeing your efforts bear no result. most groups of friends are formed in the freshmen year, and they stay pretty generic with a few additions and subtractions, and forming around greek identities, etc. like your post mentions, a lot of highly intelligent people didn't develop social skills and associate their sense of meaning from their intelligence; and  you know what tech should know that and support this development, and what of these professors that teach classes with 500,000 students in the lecture halls that don't give a fuck. asking for help is a skill that is not commonly developed by people who glided through high school with no effort (me included) and tech doesn't make it easy. 

a really fucked up thing is that if you go to the counseling center, they make you fill out a form and tell you to come back another time/schedule a later meeting. so i am feeling really depressed and instead of giving me help, i am given a form. what is really really great is that if you go to the center in the middle of the semester, they usually tell you all counselors are busy and essentially that they can't help you. 

tldr: i was a very happy and cheerful person before coming to tech, and despite having a great social life and good grades, i hated this place, and this place made me fucking depressed to no end, and though i am well adjusted again, tech made me a person that i wasn't happy or proud to be. but everyone is different so if you are happy at tech good for you, everyone isn't you. perhaps i want a 3.95 and get a job working at a financial firm instead of teaching high school mathematics.

there are other concerns you should be aware of. shootings and muggings happen in atlanta regularly. it's a big city so there is a lot of crime. campus is generally safe. i can't remember the last time there was a mugging on campus and the only shootings on campus have been by cops in recent memory.

Georgia Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia Institute of Technology/comments/1ln7qn/crime_on_campus_where_you_dont_expect_it/,"***avoiding atlanta panhandlers 101:***

**basics**

1. don't say hello, don't make eye contact, and don't smile.

2.  don't stop walking. walk around them if they are blocking your way.

3. if they say something like can i have some money say either of these phrases a) ""sorry i don't have any change."" b) ""sorry i cant help you.""
i prefer b.

4. whatever you do don't give them anything. it's a numbers game and they know it, it only takes one person in 20 to make it worth it for them. don't let people abuse your altruism, put it where it will matter if you feel guilty. harassing strangers in public is asocial and encouraging that behavior is harmful to everyone including the homeless or lesser off.


**extra tips:**

* when in a group, follow the rules, but also maintain a conversation with somebody you're walking with. it's hard to interrupt.

* if you feel guilty, buy them food. keep in mind they may not even want it and may throw it away in your face. i've heard too many anecdotes to this effect.

* in general keep in mind everything beggars and panhandlers do is meant to elicit an emotional response. they are people, but they are also people trying to hustle you for whatever their reason.

* sunglasses are a social barrier, they allow you to look at people and avoid eye contact. helpful on sunny days (and good for your eyes in general).



**hotspots for panhandling/begging/hustling:**

* marta at north ave and w peachtree. they ""ticket home"" story. used here. well dressed hustlers seem to congregate here alot. 

* north ave and spring (especially in winter) ""i need some food"" story (sometimes they really do want food, if you feel bad, buy them a burger). 

* downtown (everywhere): look what are you doing walking in downtown? anything past phillips is just asking for trouble for college kids.

* pine st and courtland av (ish): vacant lot, the most homeless people i've ever seen in one place (the metro atlanta homeless task force is nearby). just don't go anywhere near here on foot anywhere from dusk to dawn.

* atlantic station (sometimes): depending on how busy it is, sometimes you got dudes hustling, but the security usually keeps them out.

* edgewood avenue (all of it): due to the high concentration of bars for rich young people, and the proxiMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy to downtown, there are usually quite a few homeless people (some friendly). just keep walking yo, there are cops in every bar if you have problems.

* little five: if you didn't know there were homeless people here you should just leave the city. follow the four rules.

* mcdonalds off of hemphill: one guy (whom i have heard called reggae jesus) likes to nap in the mcds or bk on hemphill and northside. dudes pretty harmless but worth noting. also that gas station at the end of that row (texaco?) is my last choice to fuel up after witnessing multiple drug deals at the pump.



**advanced**

identification: panhandlers, beggars, hustlers and general homeless people in atlanta follow general types:

* crazy/drunk/high/mentally ill: disheveled appearance, muttering, conversations held with self or the air, wild looks, gestures. generally wear the uniform: anything you can get at goodwill or a shelter.

* career hustler: generally dressed in average to decent clothes, probably not even homeless, literally just standing around trying to get people to give them free money. it works too, avoid, they are usually associated with criminals.

* well dressed homeless guy: happens in atlanta more often then you think, there's alot of nice clothes floating around. not really a negative type, just keep in mind appearances can be deceiving.

* bike guy: guy with a bike. he still asks me for money. i still won't give him any.

* homeless woman: so rare its barely even worth mentioning. i've seen like maybe three. women always get the shelters first. never been asked for change by a woman ever. they do exist they are just in low numbers are you probably wont interact with them.

* cart person: they generally leave you alone, they are looking for cans or other recyclables. if you see them looking for some and have some give it to them, they are actually trying to make it honestly (perhaps in an undignified way, but we are all animals born of the dirt, dignity is made up).


*disclaimer: this guide is written not to pass judgement on ye olde poors, but to help you avoid the malicious ones. use good judgement, they are people, it's just that people, on the whole, suck. also if you get shanked that's on you*

just going to throw out a tip: never try to be a hero. in a situation like this, even a big tough u.s. marine knows that the proper response is to first try to run, and yell loudly for help. if you can't get away, try to meet their demands peacefully.

since you encountered this situation in a well-lit public area, if you ran and yelled, you would very quickly have support. people naturally come out to see what's going on when someone's yelling. that, i think, is the advantage of being in public during the day. it's not that this doesn't happen during the day, it's that there are always other people around, even if they are all strangers.

Georgia Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia Institute of Technology/comments/8ygvio/false_advertising_georgia_tech_computer/,"so this comment may seem like a pedantic one, but it is actually important. there isn t a cs department running these processes; it s the college. there aren t registration restrictions that prioritize cs majors; rather, those restrictions prioritize coc programs (which includes the computational media bs program, for example, as well as more than 10 other programs at the graduate level). 

aside from the imprecision, the reason this distinction is important is because it suggests that the issues you are identifying are largely because compe majors aren t coc students (that is, aren t in a coc program). it s not an issue of major, it s an issue of program home. contrast compe majors with cm majors. cm majors are in a program that is jointly owned by coc and lmc.  at the graduate level, coc participates in a number programs that span multiple colleges, including robotics, machine learning, cyber security, and human computer interaction (ece participates in those first three, btw). these programs enjoy some protection from the demand for coc courses because they are, in fact, coc programs.

Georgia Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia Institute of Technology/comments/8ygvio/false_advertising_georgia_tech_computer/,"i can only think of a few things that i like about the compe curriculum compared to the cs curriculum:

* it has ece2020 (intro digital design) and ece2035 (c and assembly) as separate classes rather than scrunching them into the one class like cs2110.
* it has a dsp class, which as far as i can tell the cs people never really touch.
* ece2031 is a pain in the ass, but i have actually felt a little more comfortable with parts of my job this summer because of having taken a technical document writing course.
* i get to feel superior to my cs friends who didn't take circuits.

other than that, i totally agree that the compe curriculum is garbo. ece3056 is for the most part just a worse version of cs2200 that somehow manages to feel less hands-on despite having vhdl as part of it, ece3030 is just memorizing a bunch of equations for the test, and ece3020 is so all over the place that it fails to function as a discrete math, algorithms, or data structures course.

additionally, it's really clear that the coc just has way more money they can use to improve the students' experience. there's like a 1:15 ratio of tas to students in the intro cs classes. everything just feels more organized. i have a cs *minor* and that got me after-hours access to klaus and coc, but i have to talk to the building manager for van leer if i want him to give me access there. compe classes honestly just feel bootleg as hell.

but most of the streets are fine. the  downtown  area of state street seemed a bit desolate after all the restaurants/ bars closed. but i ran it anyway. 

maybe this was thursday and during my run i noted a smaller girl who appeared to be undergrad or young grad student age. she was walking confidently on orange. (orange is also well-lit)
and then another two girls a bit later were walking and smoking/had just smoked. some laughing but they were in a pair so safer.

i feel like i could not have had a better experience anywhere else than Yale University. i lucked into my first-year suite that i still live with, i switched from being a literature major in hs to a social science applicant to an engineering major atm, and i exceeded my capacity to learn & grow each and every semester. i have my highs and lows, but i have such amazing support systems through professors, tas who became friends, friends who become suitemates, etc. that i would not trade any of my Yale University experience (except covid) for anything.

to be frank, i saw your post on the Harvard University subreddit first. i like Harvard University too, i won't lie, but throughout my time here i have realized a few things that made me ok with not going to Harvard University. (1) i will do graduate school at some point, and Harvard University seems like it invests more in its graduate training than its undergraduate training. not that the latter is subpar, but Yale University undergrads are treated really nicely. (2) location proved to be a very non-issue. i really enjoy being in a small city that has access to big cities (2 hrs to nyc, 2-3 hrs to boston). nyc has a lot more to offer than boston but also is a lot to live in, so to have that proxiMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy is great. there is also so much to do within the student body (cultural houses, suite parties, bands, club events, etc.) that i really cannot tell you anytime i wish i had been in a different city. (3) Yale University has somewhat of a bubble that let me know the names of almost everyone in my grade. this was far from the case when my Harvard University friends visited me. (4) in my experience, the school spirit flavor of Harvard University always has to do with how prestigious it is and how much of a superior choice the school is to the rest. this is my experience in the cross adMassachusetts Institute of Technology group chat when i first got in, as well as throughout Harvard University Yale Universitys, so it is rather personal.

safety is often considered a concern in new haven. i think it is not unfair i think that caution is warranted if you go through the green in the dark. i will also say that i have done that walk many times past midnight, or that i have never felt the need to call a uber/lyft in those cases. the campus itself is a lot safer than it is described i would argue that there is too much police presence on campus. they put in non-trivial measures to ensure you feel safe getting home, and it really shows in the last decade. for reference i am an international asian male.

for my undergraduate career, i have a few things that i feel like i developed the most. first is multiple big social circles that have fun with me and support me. i have my residential college friends, my student orgs friends, my other student orgs friends, my major friends, my cultural house friends, etc. that i can talk about dumb movie shows or game-theoretic rationalizations with. i think Yale University supports this slightly better with their housing model and the existence of cultural houses/peer liaisons. second is that i learn the skills to be both a specialist and a generalist thinking critically and broadly through interactions with people i share no overlapping interests with. third is that i am enabled to reach my goals however big or small. i got to go abroad on Yale University's money, do research on Yale University's money, learn filmmaking in Yale University's money, and it seems like there will be even more opportunities. i think my Yale University experience covers all the bases exceptionally well, making me both a better and a smarter person.",Comment,Neutral

i'll put it this way: a student who wasn't mexican dressed up as a mexican farmer for halloween, sombrero et pullover et al. the ensuing cancellation attempt reached maybe a second-order retweet on twitter before it fizzled out. they posted an apology to their (private) instagram story and that was the end of it. there were probably more people defending them than ragging on them. doesn't sound like a ""woke dystopia"" to me.

also if you're a conservative worried about being attacked then that's literally a non-problem. american conservatism was birthed in new haven in the 1950s by the wet nursing of william f buckley jr, and conservative/other right-wing political groups are quite prominent and definitely don't shirk. 

academically there was a course on the conservative intellectual tradition from the 18th century to today, which was well-attended, fair, and had a balanced political composition in its enrollment - no institutional stifling here. 

if anything the right probably has more institutional power at Yale University than at any other ivy, at least among the undergrad student body, and definitely not the wokepool the media has portrayed it as. the reason (i think) why this all came about was because the christakis incident was a high-profile instance of the 2015-era trend of ""professors for free speech getting cancelled by woke mob"" (which was an isolated incident at Yale University involving maybe 40 students and a massive administrative overreaction) was convenient harping bait for the media, since using the Yale University name adequately fanned populist flames (and we had a cute video to boot). actually being at Yale University is pretty far from that reality, everyone basically does whatever they want and no attempts at moralizing ever really get across to people who don't want to hear it (in either direction, but good faith debate is alive and well!)",Comment,Neutral

re: mental health, its a mix of a lot of dif factors. the school is v preprofesh and seeing students in business suits makes it hard to see them as real ppl imo, and it sometimes feels like ppl r just tryna get involved in things to boost their resume and everything else is a waste of time. bc of that, theres not many clubs that actually focus on building community. but i love the ones that do exist! i also think profs could do more to make their students lives better. and the school rly needs to invest in caps to get more and more diverse therapists. they only give short term support which is ok but tends not to be helpful for students in the long term. i think theres also something abt being in a major city that makes u feel kinda lost/overwhelmed. i love philly but i wonder what college wouldve been like if there weren t downtowns and formals and weirdly expensive and elitist events going on. last thing i can think of is there isnt a lot of encouragement to explore majors/dif interests. for example, ppl come in as premed and receive so much info about taking xyz classes asap in this certain order, and getting x number of volunteer hours, and doing blah blah blah to stay on  track . not sure how it is for other fields but it just seems like ppl tend to stay in a  lane  instead of broadening their understanding of dif topics. and also, my perception is that burnout culture is so normalized that many ppl think they should be in a million clubs/orgs and have a constantly full google calendar. 

all that being said, idk how many of these issues are specific to penn or just college in general. these are also just things that i have noticed as a senior, but there are many dif groups within penn that i havent interacted with. 10k undergrads is decently large and im sure others have had much dif experiences. i also dont rly blame an individual person for any of these things (except maybe some ppl in penn admin), but its moreso just what the culture has kind of become. it can be a very tiring, draining place and honestly im p excited to graduate.

>is there an active social life there?

sure there is. it's a pretty big school (10,000 undergrounds) so any student is bound to meet others that have the same definition of what an ""active social life"" is. 

>are there actual research opportunities?

yes sir (or madam). i conducted independent (paid) research my first summer after freshman year here at penn. others do research with professors during the school year or summer. still others chose to conduct on-site research abroad. there is a specific research resource center at penn called the center for undergraduate research and fellowships, more commonly known as curf. you should check out their website. they offer workshops, a data base of research opportunities, offer funds, and a lot more. or you can try many of the other routes to getting a research position like i did.

>how hard is the school?

of course, it depends. one of the hardest things about my freshman year was trying to figure out what sort of expectations i should set for myself. penn's academic learning environment is miles away from what my high school was like, and i had to adjust (as do the majority of students here). the great thing is that there are tons of resources that help students out (tutoring, office hours and accessible professors, wiengarten learning resources center, i can go on). penn doesn't spoon-feed anything to its students though, so you really have to take an initiative in both getting help and taking advantage of the amazing opportunities the school has to offer.

yes, as long as you put some effort into it (meet people, maybe join a club/activity, go to events, etc.)  there are parties most friday/saturday nights (if you're into that), and there are plenty of other things to do.  we work hard at penn, but we also have a lot of fun here.

because of academics, we probably don't socialize quite as much as other colleges (based on what i hear from my high school friends who go to other colleges).  some people study way too much (don't do this), but most of us have good social lives.  

> are there actual research opportunities?

yes, they do exist.  i don't personally know much about research, as i don't do any myself, but i know quite a few people who are doing it.  

penn students seem to do more stuff over the summers than during the year, though.  summer internships/research are extremely common, although a lot of them aren't at penn.  

> how hard is the school?

tough but manageable.  it isn't as tough as a school like Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but it certainly takes effort to do well.  everyone adjusts and ends up doing fine, though.  

if you are taking a standard amount of courses, engineering is a lot tougher than the college (arts and sciences).  engineers have to average about 5 classes a semester, while students in the college don't have to take more than 4-4.5 usually.  if you want to put more effort in, you can; i have met people who take 6 or even 7 classes a semester and handle it fine, although i would die if i had to take that many (i'm lazy and i probably spend way too much time on reddit).  

feel free to ask me anything else, and i hope you decide to come to penn!

i'm a sophomore majoring in computer science (in the engineering school), just so you know.

there are quite a few m&t people i know that selected engineering as their second choice. at the end of the day in such a big school like penn, you'll be sure to find a niche group of people interested in what you are too.

i know m&t students who've gone to work for dyson, big tech, and then finance/consulting too. one of my friends is really interested in biotech too (m&t), and i remember him going to a lab to work every week sophomore year. he  also seems to be  quite entrepreneurial!

i will say though that predominantly, the m&t people i know are either interested in big tech or finance/quant. this may just be a coincidence. unfortunately/fortunately depending on who you are, the finance/consulting culture at wharton is quite extreme and so to be perfectly honest, i haven't met so many people interested in pursuing entrepreneurship as a living from the get go, or working at a startup (at least in wharton). in engineering big tech is the norm, and again i personally don't know many people working at startups post grad, but i'm sure they are there.  this is just me however. (that being said i personally am on a leave of absence atm trying to start something in my home country :p and have yet to apply to internships- case being there are  people passionate about entrepreneurship at penn).

as for courseload, it always seems more daunting than it really is. wharton can really be a walk in the park or very difficult depending on the classes you choose. you'll naturally find a balance that fits you best. engineering i've found to be very difficult and time consuming. it is super collaborative though. engineering really forces you to meet people at penn and i've made a lot of good/genuine friends through it. i think case competitions in wharton might accomplish the same thing (not sure tho haven't done any). everyone gets through engineering though, so dw.

startup pros are that there's a lot of ways to raise money and incubators. i've heard that raising money through these programs really isn't that tough relative to getting money from actual vcs (ofc, funding is in relatively small quantities). cons i've implicitly mentioned already with the pervasive finance, consulting, big tech (engineering) atmosphere. i personally feel that Stanford University  has a more tech entrepreneurship/startup centric atmosphere post grad than penn from what friends there have told me.

also, for \#1: i was mostly closeted during high school but have had a lovely time being out and proud in college. haven't run into any issues from other penn students, though be warned that since we're an open campus, religious weirdos can and occasionally do set up with bigoted signs. they generally attract counter-protesters and don't do anything beyond a bit of heckling.

it's a fine environment if you just want to chill, but the community is kind of scattered so if you want to be more involved with queer culture it takes a bit of hunting to find people. we do at least have good support through the lgbt center, which funds people every year to go to various conferences like creating change and out in stem.

University of Pennsylvania,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Pennsylvania/comments/ks588s/is_penn_actually_as_bad_as_you_guys_make_it_out/,"penn is not bad. college is a time of tremendous change, and regardless of what school you choose, you'll likely feel depressed or lost at some point during the next few years. penn is a highly social school that epitomizes the 'work hard, play hard' ethos. you're expected (implicitly by the penn student body) to grind in your coursework and thrive socially. this means plenty of parties as a freshman, a plethora of social connections and engagements, and also a pressure to stay with the crowd academically.

the reality is that many people can't do this at all, and most people can't do this for four straight years. your enjoyment at penn will often be a result of your maturity. it takes a certain level of maturity and awareness to cope with newfound freedom, to accept failure, to ask for help (and there is a ton of help to be found). but penn will be best when you're mature enough to know who you are. almost nobody at penn is the 'ratrace,' and yet everyone feels compelled to compete in it. if you love the 'race' or if you're smart enough to really know you don't need to run it, you'll have a good time at penn.

i think a big part of the negative penn experience is that many of its students have never failed, have never not been the best, and don't know how to cope with that. and the people who are the best at penn, that tiny fractional echelon, will likely be the best in life too. but the rest of the penn student body has to accept, one way or the other, that they're not going to be the best, and that's a hard existential pill to swallow. a lot of people destroy themselves with coursework because they can't accept their healthy liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys and take a lower grade. then, they end up so burnt out that they get a lower grade than they otherwise would have gotten.

all of this is not to say that loneliness isn't a big part of the penn experience specifically. within the 'work hard play hard' game, you eventually have to wonder if it's all just a game, if your peers are just coparticipants rather than friends. i assume this is what life feels like too, but there is a palpable alienation underlying many social interactions, and a deracination too if you didn't come from wealth or new jersey. this part sucks, but it can overcome with a little bit of patience. rather than swing at everything, you've just got to wait for the right pitches.

all in all, penn is a great education with the cachet to propel you into success within your field. it has been an unbelievably intellectually enriching experience for me. i enjoyed the social moments, but loved the solitary ones even more (just my personal preference). philly isn't new york, but it's a wonderful city with a lot to offer. depression is a serious thing, and you need to take proactive steps to manage it if you feel it coming on. caps isn't going to take those steps for you, but it will point you in the direction you need to walk. i haven't personally dealt with that problem here though, so maybe look to others.

1) depression is rampant, but it sort of is rampant at most similarly prestigious schools. caps was helpful for me when i was an undergrad but i've heard complaints from others. (i will say that caps was much better than the analogous service i found at my grad institution)

2) gutmann just always came off as out of touch. she is far better than many other university presidents that come to mind, notably rafael reif (who scapegoated a professor to escape blame for epstein related funds he accepted and signed off on) or jerry falwell jr. (who resigned in disgrace after he went on a drunken bender and the 25 year old he liked to watch fuck his wife went on cnn). 

3) students generally don't attend more than one undergrad institution unless they're transfer students. so you're not going to get good comparisons between schools. the one comparison i can make is food related. i've had meals at two liberal arts colleges (in maine and massachusetts) and both had far better food than penn. however, after everyone gets covid and loses their sense of taste this point really won't matter anymore.",Comment,Positive

University of Pennsylvania,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Pennsylvania/comments/ks588s/is_penn_actually_as_bad_as_you_guys_make_it_out/,"i'm an international student in the college of arts and sciences, and i was in the exact same position two years ago (i'm currently a sophomore). i was choosing between penn and lse, and i almost chickened out of going to penn because i was also terrified of being stressed and depressed for four years. after two months of agonizing over the two, i took the leap of faith towards penn and i am so so glad i did. here's why:

&#x200b;

1. penn is not as bad as reddit/college confidential/the dp would have you believe. before comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyting to penn, i read all the articles about suicides, classism, alcoholism, depression, pre-professionalism etc. i ended up in this vortex of doomscrolling where all the awful stories just kept piling up, to the point where the very idea of penn terrified me. but in the end, you have to remember that these issues are prevalent at pretty much every high achieving school, and the articles represent only a tiny slice of everything that goes on at penn. i got to penn thinking that i was doomed to four years of misery and loneliness, but instead, i've found so many wonderful communities and people who have made my life so much richer for knowing them. of course, it's not perfect and there are not-so-great people like you would have at any other school, but most people i have met have been extremely warm and supportive. my penn interviewer (who actually went here for undergrad) told me ""the best part of penn is the people,"" and so far, i think she's absolutely right. there have definitely been times at penn when my mental health has taken a plunge, but my penn friends definitely helped a lot.
2. there is so much room for you to grow and explore here! most of my secondary school friends went to the uk (oxbridge, lse, imperial, ucl, russell group, etc.). while i was initially really freaked out by the idea of doing something so different from most of the people around me, i think i've had the most fulfilling uni experience out of everyone i know back home. frankly, i think it's slightly ridiculous that uk unis make you comMassachusetts Institute of Technology to a course when you're like 17, and expect you to do nothing but that for three years  we're going into a workforce which will require multiple skills and ways of thinking. the major i'm currently leaning towards isn't that far off from the courses i applied to on ucas, but i'm so much happier with it than the pre-selected modules i would have had to do in the uk. also, penn has given me amazing opportunities  i've worked with academics i grew up idolizing, and projects that i never even knew existed. my friends in the uk also work on cool stuff, but nothing on the scale that penn gives to undergrads.
3. penn is tough. it's really, really tough. but it's doable, and i think it's worth it. something which i found really difficult to adjust to at first was having to work at a consistent level throughout the semester  i did igcses and a-levels, so i was used to leaving all the work until study leave (which you only get two days of at penn). eventually, i got used to it, and i'm finding that it's a lot nicer than everything relying on a set of final papers. one of the hardest parts of my penn experience has been learning how to not get hung up on a single bad grade (sometimes a row of them). but again, the people here can be your best asset  so many problems can be made better by talking to other people, because trust me, everyone struggles with something. also, you'll develop a crazy work ethic and become a lot more efficient  at my summer internship (in my home country), i found that i worked 5x faster than the other interns, just because for better or worse, penn turns you into a machine.

&#x200b;

Columbia University is a better fit for that. and if it turns out that you want the intense stem, i'm sure you can talk to profs and find good research opportunities at Columbia University. if you don't want what California Institute of Technology offers, you would be incredibly unhappy there.

honestly though, i would probably let the tiebreaker be more about where you have to live to attend each school. California Institute of Technology is in pasadena. while you will probably live on campus all four years, developing a fraternity-esque bond with your housemates, it's got a bit of an upper-class suburb vibe in the surrounding area. it's a nice place but nothing particularly exciting. on the other hand, Columbia University is right there in nyc, with all the positives and negatives that come with big city life. that may be appealing to you, or it may be a big reason to stay away depending on what you want. just know that they are very different ways of life, and making sure you live in a place you like will significantly help with keeping you from burning out.",Comment,Positive

>how much has this changed their focus throughout the years?

i can't give you a big-picture view, but i can tell you that the cs department's recent hires (for ug classes) have been great lecturers.

&#x200b;

>what has your experience been with California Institute of Technology's core curriculum?

it was alright. honestly, i was just super scared of proofs going in. i didn't do ma 0 over the summer (oops), and i struggled in ma 1a until after midterms. after that, the rest of ma 1 felt pretty straightforward.

re: ch 1, ph 1-- they were also alright. there were a lot of times when i ran into walls, but that's what friends + collaboration are for.

some people complain about the humanities courses we have to take, but i tend to like those classes/appreciate that we don't have to deal with math/science all the time.

&#x200b;

>at what point in your undergraduate career do you dive headfirst into your major?

there's not a lot of room in frosh schedules for taking major specific classes. cs students can take ma 6a (discrete math) during their frosh fall, but i don't think many people do (since 1) you're typically easing into college life, 2) proofs, esp. if you're not already experienced w/ them, and 3) you'd typically have to swap out your frosh hum for another term). most cs majors take it either sophomore or junior year fall term.

most cs majors take cs 2 during their frosh winter-- that's your data structures class. some of them also take cs 21 then in lieu of a humanities course. if you think you're up to the task, then you can go for it. i personally did 2/21 my frosh winter, and i didn't like it. i was honestly not ready to take the class at that time.

cs 24 (computing systems) used to be offered in the spring, (my class was the last batch of frosh that could take it then) but it's been moved to the fall. you can take cs 3 (software design), which was a pretty fun class-- we had to design a game from the ground up in c (fair warning: this might've changed since spring 2019, as it was a freshly redesigned class then).

you could also do cs 38 (algorithms) your spring term frosh year-- again, if you're up to the task. most frosh don't, though. (spring 2020 was an exception-- we were on universal p/f, so people were capitalizing on that opportunity pretty hard.)

\*cs 1 is offered fall term. many, many frosh take that class, even if they're not planning on majoring in cs. you can test out if you want-- that'd free up some room in your schedule and allow for ma 6a your frosh fall without replacing your humanities.",Comment,Positive

hi! i run 1064cbread, a [ctf](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) team. i brought it with me to California Institute of Technology when i went. i have since graduated, but we maintain a solid contingent of current students that play with us. we are generally people who are pretty happy to talk about infosec and assembly hacking and reversing and crypto, but unfortunately i think that constitutes a majority of the infosec exposure that undergrads get at California Institute of Technology.

i do know one or two people that did infosec work while at California Institute of Technology, in the context of ml threat detection stuff? but it's an area that California Institute of Technology is very lacking in.

in general California Institute of Technology's cs program (disclaimer: i was not a cs major) seems to focus a lot on the approach of... ""we'll teach you the 'hard' mathy parts and theorems and theory, actually figuring out how to put it into practice is something you can do on your own, right?"". and something as *""mechanical""* as building exploit chains or reversing some assembly or probing firewall rules doesn't really get much attention, then.

but at the same time, there is a grain of truth in that approach: the undergrads on 1064cbread generally taught themselves everything they needed about cybersecurity, through ctfs and talking with their friends, and seemed content with that.

1.  seek help now.  there's no shame in getting counseling.  tech is tough - but the entire transition to college life is tough.  they cover a bunch in frosh camp, and i still remember this: California Institute of Technology takes the top 2% of the country.  so even if you're not in the top half, you're still in the top 2%.   

2. it depends.  if you get by now in high school by only doing hard work, you're going to have an even rougher time.  it's okay if you're not the smartest - everyone has to bust ass at tech.  but you do need some natural ability also.  there simply aren't enough hours in the day if your main mode is to power through something.  you need some natural aptitude as well.  again though - you got accepted.  you'll also get an evaluation so they can place you properly.

3. it depends.  sleep, grades, social life - pick 2.  i did the ee major, and junior year was rough.  pulling overnighters 3-4 times a week was common.  but again, it really depends.

4. you will probably do fine.  there's a wide range, but most people at California Institute of Technology are fairly normal imo.  

5. the house system is pretty good, even if it has been watered down... (that's just us crotchety old alums talking)  but each house has its own flavor, despite them ""all being fine houses"".  downtown la is a good half hour by car away.  west side (University of California Los Angeles, westwood) like 45 minutes.  it's totally doable to get out there if you want - but you need a car (it's la).  pasadena is pretty nice and you probably don't even need to go to la really.

6. no way.  that tech cred goes a long way - but you still need to bust ass and get good grades.  plus i've made life long friends and connections that are pretty bad ass.  while you're doing it, it'll be painful.  (""California Institute of Technology is a great place to be from, but not a great place to be at"") 

you are not the first person to have these issues.  California Institute of Technology is notorious for being a pressure cooker and they've worked hard for many years to be more supportive.  could it be better?  yes - but there are systems in place and things are designed to make the transition better.  hell, your first two terms (out of 3 per year) are pass/fail to help.

also, not being the genius in the class may be beneficial to your mental health.  there are many stories of folks who were ""big fish in a small pond"" - they came from a small town and were top of their class for their entire lives.  then they get to tech and they're just average and they can't handle it and short circuit.

1. i don't think i'm qualified to answer this. however, at orientation, the admin had a lot of emphasis on seeking help. there are also peer advocates and residential associates who are always willing to help and talk with you.
2. not everyone at California Institute of Technology is a ""genius,"" because i certainly am not one. i was still able to earn great shadow grades and have adequate social life. some people are good at different subjects, some are average in most subjects; however, nobody judges you for it. California Institute of Technology (so far) is very doable with hard-work; natural talents will help make it easier but is by no means required. the most important thing you have to realize is, that it is **ok to ask for help** from your peers or go to office hours. you'll save a lot of frustrations and learn even faster than just banging your head against a set.
3. i get about 7-8 hours of sleep each night. i usually sleep around 2 am to 9 am.
4. there are some nerdy people, there are some not-very-nerdy people. if you got accepted, you will certainly find a group of friends who are as nerdy or not as nerdy as you want them to be. everyone has their quirks and it's fun getting to know people.
5. i have plenty of time to socialize. you will very quickly realize that your socialization time will blend into your collaborative homework time. besides that, my free time is taken up by house events and the like.
6. nah, i have a pretty positive experience with California Institute of Technology so far.

2. yes California Institute of Technology is hard, however i think someone who had to work hard in high school will actually be better off than someone who didnt. i had a pretty easy time in high school (by no means a genius though i do know some at California Institute of Technology now) and it took me most of frosh and smore year to really learn how to work hard and do good. hard work is more important than genius in my opinion

3. i get 8hrs of sleep a night and still have some amount of free time. California Institute of Technology is what you make of it, i personally choose a slightly lighter course load (40ish units/about 4 classes) and am much happier with that. i know people though who like to have lots of work and no free time. if sleep or socializing or some other extra curricular is important, then there are ways to make it work if you put in the effort.

4. there is a wide range of people at tech. if your discord is anything like my classes groupme then its just the bias of the nerdiest people being the talkative ones. im sure youll meet plenty of people you fit in with if you come here

5. i have plenty of time to socialize. esp with the house system, i feel like its very easy to socialize in the time between other things since everyone is so close. as for going into la; again, if you want to have time to go into la, you ll find the time for it. i personally almost never leave campus but thats my preference.

6. i don t regret going to California Institute of Technology. i met some of my closest friends (though i m sure that would be true of any school). on the other hand, i think i would have had an easier time at a state school as well as a slightly higher gpa. theres a balance between the prestige of California Institute of Technology and the work it takes to be here and its impossible to know if i would have been happier/more successful anywhere else",Comment,Neutral

1: i am not totally sure about this as i do not personally have a lot of experience. however, during orientation they told us that there are a lot of mental health resources here. also, since it is such a small school, i feel like everyone really looks out for each other, and i have felt like upperclassmen especially are super helpful and supportive of new freshman as we transitioned to college.

2: yes, California Institute of Technology is very challenging academically. however, the work is totally doable. hard work, time management, and making use of resources are the key. i think that resources is a big one - so far i have had several times in multiple classes where i felt completely confused and lost, but by going to office hours and using upperclassmen tutors i was able to get through it and learn the material very well.  honestly, i think that of being either  hard working type  or  genius type , hard working is much more important at California Institute of Technology, as nobody who comes in knows everything that they are trying to teach us, and i think it is totally doable if you are willing to work hard to get it done.

3: there is definitely less free time at California Institute of Technology than at other schools, but i don t really feel bothered by this. most people that i know are in a club or a few. lots of people find time to play musical instruments, go to the gym, cook, and stuff like that. i will say that i have not explored la as much as i would have like to yet, as i have only gone into the city twice so far. i typically get 7 or 8 hours of sleep per night. 

4: i would say don t worry about this one too much. i was concerned as well before o chose California Institute of Technology that everyone would just be super nerdy and not socially adapted, but i have found this to be not the case at all! yes, most everyone here is passionate about stem, but people also have lots of other passions and many are super sociable and fun. also, i definitely would say don t base your impression of your incoming class off of the people who are active on the group chats, there is some major selection bias there. also, i think that the house system is a wonderful thing that helped me and a lot of others to find the people that we really clicked with.

5: again, i think that the house system is a great way to have an initial social group, and to find people who may have similar interests to you. for me right now, most of my social group is people who live in the same house as me. also, one thing i love about California Institute of Technology is that it is super easy to make friends with people who are in all different grade levels, and you are not isolated to only hanging out with other freshman. i would say that i feel like i have a lot of time to socialize with others, and almost all of the times when i have stayed up later than i wanted to was because i was just hanging out, and not because i was scrambling to finish a homework set.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/ehyab5/would_California Institute of Technology_be_a_good_choice/,"first off congratulations. i started as a freshman at California Institute of Technology in 1985. i have basically been on one university campus or another since then ( i am a professor at a big state school). 

1. by all means do what you have to to keep yourself healthy. college is a big transition and will be regardless of where you go. California Institute of Technology might have more stressors. it is also a small community and might provide more support. mental health support for undergrads at my school is a joke: 40,000+ undergraduate students and one counselor. 

2. i have seen a couple of contradictory answers here. i am firmly of the opinion that the people who struggled the most at tech were the people who just skated through high school without having to work. you are smart enough to do this: if you have good work habits you will be fine. i did not and had to learn them.

3. i feel like there was free time. there were certainly some all-nighters and times like finals week where things were pretty intense, but it was certainly not like the whole quarter was like that, or even most of it. 

4. it is a small community, and the house system provides kind of a natural social group. your discord experience reminded me of a freshman barbeque i went to the day i arrived. i ended up in this group of the most pretentious nerds i have ever run across. every one of them was talking about all the advanced classes they'd taken in high school, and i was just thinking to myself ""geaddaddy what the f**k did you come here for?"" but in a day or two i met some people and started to find people i got along with and never looked back. these kinds of people are around, and tend to be the first thing you notice, but i dont think that most techers are like this. 

5. i had time to socialize and to see the city. it helps to either have a car or a friend with a car. i dated someone who lived in la proper most of my sophomore year, so i spent almost every weekend there that year. most of the rest of the time la was an occasional destination, but it is certainly something that you can do. pasadena is great too though. old town was kind of a dump when i first arrived but by my senior year it was really a hip destination. if you like architecture pasadena gas a higher density of craftsman style bungalows than anywhere else. 

6. no way. i loved it there. no regerts at all.

it seems to me like you are asking two questions here. ""can i do it?"" and ""should i do it?"" the answer to the first is yes. you got in. you are smart enough: if you apply yourself you can do it. the answer to the second is more complicated.  if you are sure that you want to do something in math, science or engineering then i feel that there is no place better in the world to be a student. if you are not sure if you want to go into stem then it might not be the right choice.

1. do not suffer in silence. your chances are best if you get help early and stick with it. the school's counseling center is an invaluable resource, but mostly as a stepping stone to a permanent therapist.

2. this is the most difficult program you can find. hard work will get you far, but building a good study group and getting help when you need it will be crucial to not getting buried. find people whose work habits are similar to yours.

3. *ha*

4. there are all kinds of people here. pretty much everyone describes themselves as ""chill"", so don't focus on that as a useful term. ask them how they spend their time and try to find common ground.

&#x200b;

1. yes, depression is quite common. my guess is that the combination of selection effects and generic college stressors are a bigger factor here than anything unique to the environment at California Institute of Technology, but i have no data to back that up. the counseling center is free for students, but your mileage may vary as to the quality.
2. depends on what you mean by 'hardworking' and 'be ok'- and, frankly, on your major. you're not going to be able to get perfect grades taking a full load as a ee while working the number of hours your classes say you should have to work whether you're a genius or not. but most people at tech are not geniuses, and nonetheless almost everyone graduates- and most of those who don't *could,* but have decided (entirely reasonably) that it's not worth it for them.
3. sleep is hugely variable. i knew people who slept four hours a night. i knew people who slept from 11:30-8:00 every single day. i knew people who slept whenever they felt like it, for however long they felt like. in any given term, almost everyone probably had at least one week with almost no work, and one week where they were working near-continuously, but most people, most of the time, had at least a few hours of free time per day.

1. i can't speak for how California Institute of Technology is now, but from my ancient experience of being there in the 90s, there has always been a lot of informal support from other students. i can't say whether you'd suffer greatly or not, but make sure you take advantage of the resources California Institute of Technology has in terms of mental health.
2. it's generally do-able, and it requires hard work. there are support structures in place, primarily for the core curriculum: use them! go to recitation section, go to office hours when you need them. there are true geniuses at California Institute of Technology, but you soon learn that they have liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys to their genius, and there are things that are difficult for them. one way or another, California Institute of Technology will make you work hard, genius or not.
3. it depends, but you'll generally sleep less as you progress, with the general sleep minimum being in junior year, where your option's meatiest courses are typically scheduled. in general, techers don't have much free time. there's a reason you don't typically see California Institute of Technology doing well at events you might expect California Institute of Technology students to do really well at (e.g. robot competitions, trivia bowls, other collegiate contests), and that's simply a lack of time and brain budget.
4. it's a nerd school and it's small. that said, there's generally always a range, and the main point of the house system is to help you fit in. don't worry about what you see in the discord, as incoming students typically want to flex their nerd credentials like some sort of nerd peacock. it's surprising that at such a tiny school, you'll generally find your tribe.
5. yes. you can have a social life. is it going to be wild parties every weekend, filled with beautiful people? no. but, you and your fellow students will spend a lot of time with each other, and you'll likely have a lot of social interactions that occur spontaneously. coming from a small town, la in general can be intimidating. it's a place where the stereotypes can be very powerful, and you have to work a bit to find things that vibe with you. this is a region of the world where if you want to do some activity, it's probably available to do here.
6. i don't regret it, but it is not a school for everyone. i think that you should at least hear, and understand later, that California Institute of Technology is first and foremost a research institution. undergraduate education is likely lower on the institute's priority list than sorting out faculty parking. that said, if there's some science/engineering/nerdy thing you want to learn, California Institute of Technology offers unique opportunities to learn from some of the very best. they were hired as researchers, not teachers, but most are pretty friendly and happy to pass their wisdom on. you'll know/hear quickly who those are and are not.

all of the students worked their asses off to get here.  and when you get into California Institute of Technology it feels like a finish line of some sort.  buts it s not, in fact everyone is still running top speed!  faster and faster we run as we look to the left and right of us.  so tired from this long race, we are!  but still, we keep running.  the people that do well are those who like to run.  the people whose life long dream was to cross this immaculate finish line, stumble and often stop running from burn out.  

i have no idea what you want and what your goals are.  but if you want to go to California Institute of Technology, you have to have enjoyed the slow burn of getting there in the first place because it is very hard.  (what does very hard mean, you ask?)  i know many who have literally become changed people.  as if the work and the stress and the competition accumulated into some form of ptsd.  i laugh at what other schools have for homework in comparable classes (yes, even Massachusetts Institute of Technology).  and although sometimes it feels like there is no end to all of this work, if you love to run you ll be fine.  

as for the acm major, i have a lot of respect for acm people.  always very thoughtful and bright students.  there is healthy collaboration from what i ve seen.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/mwl4qx/choosing_between_berkeley_met_eecs_haas_and/,"i am a berkeley undergrad coming to California Institute of Technology for a phd. 

i think you might be over planning. both have great name recognition. both are research powerhouses. berkeley probably has more real business opportunities at least at the school. and the culture difference between berkeley met and California Institute of Technology (cs?) is probably pretty different, in terms of met being more business / entrepreneurship focused. but you could probably do either from either. California Institute of Technology probably does more to help you find a research position, but in my experience people who want to do research at berkeley almost always can. if you are very set on a particular field (eg ml) then California Institute of Technology may be a better bet. 

others can probably elaborate better on all of these things.

here is what i think i can add: this is a long and elaborate plan, but you're just entering college and plans and interests change. you seem very eager to get on with things after college, but remember to think about your college experience itself. going to a school that will facilitate growth and exploration is probably more important than any of the differences listed above. i really can't tell you which school will facilitate more growth, but berkeley certainly has a greater diversity of people and perspectives. you'll find people with master plans about going into elite academia or faang companies, and people smoking weed on the glade. many of them are the same people, and many start out in one camp and switch to the other. i think relaxing a bit, focusing on the present, and exploring your interests and passions is really important, and you should remember that whichever school you choose. 

then, there's the question of where you would be happier. both are great schools and communities. California Institute of Technology has a residential living / dining situation in a way that berkeley doesn't (at least for most students after the first year). this can be a nice community. berkeley probably has a wider breadth of perspectives than California Institute of Technology... you're more likely to find people who care about the same things you do, whatever that ends up being. both are in nice areas, i think berkeley is a nicer city than pasadena. both have lots of clubs, but i get the impression the smaller size of California Institute of Technology lowers the barrier and more of the students get involved. not sure about this though. in any case, you can't grind your way through 4 years of college just to get on to the next thing. you'll be more successful when you're happier and following your interests. 

i don't mean any of this in a ""chill out"" or ""don't be ambitious"" sense. i mean it more in a ""know thyself"" sense. especially when you're in college, ""thyself"" is changing, so in order to know thyself you need to be able to explore and grow. just keep all of that in mind :).

name recognition for met is a non-issue. berkeley eecs and haas have the name recognition to carry you wherever you want to go in industry. that said, i think California Institute of Technology undergrads have the highest turnover to phd s (and in top programs) than any other undergrad program in the us. in general you re correct that California Institute of Technology grads are more  uniformly  eye-catching from recruiters  standpoints.

bair is insanely competitive. i mean, if you got into California Institute of Technology then you can probably get into bair if you tried, but it s no guarantee. you need multiple a+ s in notoriously hard classes at a school that is known for  grade deflation  relative to peer institutions. personally i never got involved in research at berkeley so i don t have first-hand knowledge though. (for context, my undergrad career was very unusual, and i feel that my getting into California Institute of Technology and succeeding here has involved more than a few strokes of good luck).

you are definitely right that research (and good research) is more of a sure thing at California Institute of Technology. my advisors just hired two surfs for summer project i proposed.

i think the breadth of opportunities will be wider at berkeley. there s just so much going on in the sf bay.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/mwl4qx/choosing_between_berkeley_met_eecs_haas_and/,"the impression i get from this post is that you're thinking of education as a financial arrangement: you trade $x and y hours of work now for easier access to employment opportunity z tomorrow. that probably sounds like an accusation, but i don't mean it that way: the undercurrent in academic culture that says pursuing ""the life of the mind"" makes you better and smarter than people in industry is no different from the sort of empty status-seeking you see in /r/cscareerquestions. you're a lot wiser than i was at 18 if you've seen through it. 

but it's the wrong attitude for California Institute of Technology. yes, tech is very prestigious. yes, you will come out the other end with marketable skills and a resume that turns heads long enough to give you a chance to demonstrate them. but that resume will reflect about 10% of the work you put in. the only real evidence of the other 90% will exist entirely in your head. 

you've probably gotten variations on this speech dozens of times: tech is hard, you have to drink from a firehose, it's not like other schools. take them seriously. if this sounds unspeakably awful, then go somewhere else. obviously. i heard all the same cliches as a prefrosh: i thought they sounded *great*. and it was. but there were a lot of people for whom life at tech was not great. for me, ""drinking from a firehose"" was like setting an alarm: i *want* to wake up in the morning, and if a few seconds of stress are what it takes to keep my sleep brain in line, then so be it. for other people, it was more like having a fire alarm go off five nights in a row: it's profoundly unpleasant, and accomplishes nothing, and now if there's ever a real fire, half the hovse is just going to assume the frosh put a phone in the microwave again and go back to sleep.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/g0kz2v/help_ease_my_concerns_choosing_California Institute of Technology_over_Carnegie Mellon University/,"i'll comment on a subset of your points.

1. the size of California Institute of Technology core is misleading. there are two main parts: 1) your frosh schedule is essentially locked in, as you have to take ma 1abc, ph 1abc, ch 1ab, and some other frosh classes people sometimes put off like bi 1, menu class, ch 3a, and so on. from the perspective of a cs person, you probably won't learn anything """"""useful"""""" here, but having been exposed to rigorous math, physics, and chem is just generally useful core knowledge. especially if you want to do research... 2) the hum requirement, you have to take 12 total hums, one per term. two of these are frosh hums, which honestly feel like high school english classes and kind of suck. but the hum requirement can also be satisfied by: language classes, econ classes, social science classes, philosophy classes, and of course english / history classes...honestly only 3/12 of the hums i took were at all annoying. the other 9/12 were extremely enjoyable and a welcome break from my more difficult stem classes.
2. ""several courses not offered this year, without any information about their return"" due to its small size, California Institute of Technology has a lot of classes which happen every other year. this is not clearly advertised so it's hard to distinguish between ""never offered"" and ""offered regularly every other year"". if you have specific classes in mind, you can ask current students to check the tqfrs and see when the class was previously offered.
3. anecdotally: ""pure cs"" research opportunities, as in computer science theory, are relatively rare but not impossible to get. other cs research is more common. also ""collaborations with other departments"" doesn't have to be a bad thing, that's a huge part of California Institute of Technology's (cs) philosophy. ([https://www.ist.California Institute of Technology.edu/csx/](https://www.ist.California Institute of Technology.edu/csx/))
4. depends on the subject. there are (almost) no restrictions on grad courses, so just consider it an additional part of the catalog. 
5. ""has the California Institute of Technology  network  helped you at all?"" yes, but also, obviously. wherever you go, you are networking at least a bit. 

""my primary interest is in robotics, i d likely take additional classes  in ee/me/robotics/cds regardless of where i go. on cs, i d say i m  slightly more practically oriented than theoretical (in subject area,  not looking for an swe degree), but that doesn t mean i m not excited  about plt/category theory, cryptography, or the mathematics of  distributed systems."" i know people like this at California Institute of Technology. they major in cs, do robotics clubs / work in robotics labs, and due to the flexibility of the cs major, have the freedom to explore random other stuff they're interested in. what you've described here is totally doable and won't be inhibited by core. 

p.s. if you want to learn """"""category theory"""""" take ma 5a",Comment,Neutral
California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/g0kz2v/help_ease_my_concerns_choosing_California Institute of Technology_over_Carnegie Mellon University/,"1. sometimes, yes. however, since core is frontloaded, it became less of an issue towards the end of my degree. i enjoyed the hums and social science courses but that tends to be very person-dependent. i used more of core than i expected in part because it allowed me to take courses outside of cs such as astrobiology that i got a lot out of. 

2.  on average the courses had appropriate depth although there were outliers.  the curriculum tends heavily towards theory (see: cs21 and cs38, probably the two hardest major-required courses). California Institute of Technology has a tendency to push theory at you and expect you to do the practical aspects on your own time. as an alum, California Institute of Technology alone doesn't prepare you well enough for routine swe work and you should expect to do 1-2 industry internships to get that experience. 

3. since your interest is in robotics jpl and the meche department have most of that research and it is accessible to undergrads. pure-cs research requires a little more work afaik.

4. it's required to take some amount of courses considered graduate-level (100-level). 200-level courses are somewhat rarer for undergrads to take. 

5. i appreciated the analytical aspects of core a lot and the general skillset it teaches is worthwhile even if core itself could be improved. that much is broadly usable. the California Institute of Technology name and network is wonderful and opens a ton of doors.",Comment,Positive
California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/g0kz2v/help_ease_my_concerns_choosing_California Institute of Technology_over_Carnegie Mellon University/,"hey. i was in the exact same situation as you (Carnegie Mellon University scs vs California Institute of Technology) a couple of weeks ago and i eventually chose California Institute of Technology. i'll list the reasons why i chose California Institute of Technology below. they might not necessarily answer your questions but it might give you some different things to consider that maybe you haven't thought of before.

1. California Institute of Technology's core curriculum, although it may seem unnecessary, i think is very important. i'm interested in learning about different sciences, and i think that California Institute of Technology's core curriculum does that really well. i am also planning to do cs, but i think that knowing about all sciences in some sort of depth will help you everywhere you go. you'll understand and be able to collaborate with a lot more people. collaboration is really big in today's world. like you said robotics and creating a good functioning robot is not just purely cs, there are a lot of other subjects that also need to be known, yk? also the hum classes. i've heard that mostly it's nice because people get  a little break from doing so much stem work. i mean everybody who attends California Institute of Technology obviously loves stem but sometimes it's nice to take a break and the hums allow students that.
2. i'm not too sure about the lack of cs classes but i know that people have been mostly satisfied. also people say that internship questions are more theoretical based stuff so people have said that they don't really have to prep for internship interviews because California Institute of Technology prepares them well by their theory-based curriculum. also people have said that if you want to pursue a masters or phd  California Institute of Technology prepares you really well for that.
3. also not to sure about the lack of cs research, but i know they do have career fairs and students typically get really good opportunities there. i've talked to only 5 current California Institute of Technology students and 3 of them have internships at facebook this summer (unless corona cancels it). i mean its def not a good sample size, but i mean 3 facebook internships in a class of 200 kids isn't bad at all. and if you don't get an internship freshman year then you can do the surf program. maybe it won't be pure cs but the fact that you can get research so early puts you ahead of a lot of kids. plus the competition for research isn't bad so you should be able to get a good project to work on.
4. California Institute of Technology is on the quarter system and Carnegie Mellon University is on the semester system. idk which one you prefer or if you really prefer any but that's another thing that you can keep in mind.
5. Carnegie Mellon University does have great oppertunities no doubt. i've talked to a couple of people and they said they like Carnegie Mellon University because of the research opportunities and good name in the cs industry. but so does California Institute of Technology sooo
6. jplllllll. lol that's really big plus for California Institute of Technology imo
7. i'm also from california so staying in california is ideal for me. also apparently Carnegie Mellon University is hella depressing whereas California Institute of Technology is in pasadena which is a very nice area.
8. idk if you have already but attending the California Institute of Technology webinar things is good to learn more. 
9. also California Institute of Technology has hella noble laureates. i think that's super cool and exciting. i'm def doing cs but i really do want to learn about other subjects so having people that are literal experts in their fields is a big plus. also yk you can get so much clout hahah by saying youre like friends with a noble laureate or if you work in one of their labs soooo. California Institute of Technology has like 70ish while Carnegie Mellon University only has like 10ish
10. California Institute of Technology is a small school and that's something i like too. also it's all stem kids yk which i like a lot because there's mainly gonna be stem talk and i like that. plus University of Southern California and University of California Los Angeles aren't too far away so i mean you can always visit those school if you want more parties.

side note: i haven't done much research about Carnegie Mellon University.  i applied to both rd so California Institute of Technology came in early march whereas Carnegie Mellon University came in late march. during the time period between California Institute of Technology's acceptance and Carnegie Mellon University's acceptance i thought a lot about California Institute of Technology so it really grew on me. then when Carnegie Mellon University came in i def did consider it but i was already kinda set on California Institute of Technology. also i've obviously been brainwashed by California Institute of Technology cuz people are trying to convince me to go there. also the information i've collected is from a couple of students so it might not represent the majority of what other California Institute of Technology students are doing/feeling.

also one thing that my parents always say is that a cs degree is a cs degree regardless of where you come from. however, the research, internships, projects, networking, essentially experience is what will carry you through. and also a lot of people say that their school didn't really prepare them well for internships. it's the experience of actually being an intern that helps prepare you for the workforce. you can't really go wrong in your decision, but imo California Institute of Technology is such a golden opportunity to not only learn from the best but also be surrounded by the best of the best.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/g0kz2v/help_ease_my_concerns_choosing_California Institute of Technology_over_Carnegie Mellon University/,"i think your percentages might be inaccurate for core classes. to break down a bit:

California Institute of Technology requires ~99 units (12 classes, 3 math, 3 physics, 2 chem, 1 bio, 1 menu, 1 chem lab, 1 additional lab) of stem courses that aren't required by your major. they also require 108 units (12 classes, split up between humanities and social sciences) of humanities courses. 

looking at Carnegie Mellon University's cs major requirements, they have (to the best of my interpretation): 2-3 math courses that match California Institute of Technology's core math courses and 4 courses outside cs in general science/engineering. this is 6-7 courses in stem, not sure how units work at Carnegie Mellon University. they also require 63 units (which i think is 7 courses) in the humanities. 

however, these counts are a lot closer than you'd expect once you factor in that Carnegie Mellon University is a semester school. this averages out to 1 stem and 1 hum per California Institute of Technology term, and a little under that (.75 and .83) per Carnegie Mellon University semester. 

to be fair to the cs major at California Institute of Technology though, they also require 18 units of more difficult stem courses (normally done in the physics department), which brings up the numbers a bit on California Institute of Technology. there are also some more freeform requirements in math, engineering, and cs for California Institute of Technology which i think would probably be covered by Carnegie Mellon University's cs major requirements.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/g0kz2v/help_ease_my_concerns_choosing_California Institute of Technology_over_Carnegie Mellon University/,"i think it comes down to an overgeneralized comparison that goes like:

1. go to California Institute of Technology if you plan on pursuing academia, using science to discover groundbreaking tech, and/or really value the personal feel.
2. go to Carnegie Mellon University if you want to focus on being a software engineer. i've heard California Institute of Technology cs students also very frequently get jobs at top companies - in fact, [this](https://www.ivyachievement.com/computer-science-rankings/) source says that California Institute of Technology is the best in terms of job recruitment/salary for cs - and the flexibility at tech really lets you choose what you want to do with cs in the future.

my conclusion is that you should go to California Institute of Technology unless you really, really value the location or interacting with students from within the humanities. i'm currently choosing between berkeley eecs and California Institute of Technology, which is a somewhat similar decision to what you're making. currently leaning towards California Institute of Technology too.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/g0kz2v/help_ease_my_concerns_choosing_California Institute of Technology_over_Carnegie Mellon University/,"i graduated from California Institute of Technology in 2003, so my experience with California Institute of Technology cs is dated. back then, cs was not available as an official undergraduate option. as a result, my degree is in engineering and applied science. i didn't actually complete all the coursework necessary to get the ""cs concentration"" listed on my transcript. (the degree would still have been in e&as.)

i came to California Institute of Technology with ap calculus and ap physics under my belt, and i really struggled with core. although you might emerge from core with stronger problem solving skills, i didn't find it worthwhile and didn't retain much. 

core liMassachusetts Institute of Technologys what courses you have time to take in your first two years. when i was there, people interested in cs took the intro cs series in freshman year and a series on computability and automata in sophomore year. the intro cs series was heavy on programming, but many California Institute of Technology cs courses are more theoretical. the cs courses at California Institute of Technology didn't and still don't offer great breadth. however, i did take a compilers course because there happened to be a prof who did compiler research. he left several years after i graduated, and as far as i know, there is no compilers ocurse anymore. 

many California Institute of Technology students probably improve their programming skills on their own. that's also not unusual for cs students everywhere. in general, California Institute of Technology students do well at getting hired by top tech firms. however, i haven't done very well and have trouble passing technical interviews.",Comment,Neutral
California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/g0kz2v/help_ease_my_concerns_choosing_California Institute of Technology_over_Carnegie Mellon University/,"as someone who was also in the same position a few years ago (and had the luxury of visiting both), i'll comment on a few things that will hopefully help (if you haven't already decided lol):

\- the size of California Institute of Technology is definitely an overall academic advantage. most of my specific comments will reflect this (small pool means you're a bigger fish kind of thing).

\- i've gotten research at California Institute of Technology by simply asking. i didn't end up choosing Carnegie Mellon University so i can't say for them, but our cs department head literally emails undergraduates on behalf of professors who want assistants. you should probably talk to Carnegie Mellon University students to see what its like on their side.

\- to point 2a: California Institute of Technology's department is pretty small. however, i feel like 4 years of school is pretty small. even if i was in a much larger school, i doubt anyone would have the ability to explore cs extremely thoroughly. however, California Institute of Technology is really good at fundamentals. though there may not be as many cs courses as other schools, the foundations in those classes are extremely rigorous and help me be able to learn more niche material on my own.

\- 4. there is less of a undergrad/grad distinction at California Institute of Technology (not sure about Carnegie Mellon University). i have been in multiple classes with grad students. i would say it is extremely common as a cs major. California Institute of Technology is so small (professor wise and student wise) that instead of teaching varying levels of the same thing, one thorough class is offered. California Institute of Technology's core is really strong for reasons such as this. i kind of like that there aren't ""watered down"" versions of classes for undergraduates because if i learn something i'd rather learn it thoroughly the first time, but it also means a decent amount of work! (also, i'm sure there are differing opinions on this.)

\-- other things to keep in mind --

since your class will not have the luxury of visiting campuses, i wanted to share some on campus things that helped me decide.

\- when i visited California Institute of Technology, the admissions office picked me up from the airport, helped me store my luggage so i could roam campus, people went out of their way to welcome me (my prefrosh lanyard was a dead giveaway), the admissions office paid for my meals and my host personally gave me a tour. at Carnegie Mellon University, the admissions office told me they did not have the space to store everyone's luggage so they stored no one's luggage. lugging my sleeping bag and belongings across campus all day was definitely not fun and i remember walking into the city to buy food with other Carnegie Mellon University prospectives. there was nothing wrong with the way Carnegie Mellon University did things, but California Institute of Technology's approach was really impactful in contrast.

\- at California Institute of Technology, the community seemed a lot stronger during prefrosh experience. collaboration is heavily emphasized and the house system definitely reinforces friendships - people's doors were open for conversation and it was definitely a lively aptmosphere. at Carnegie Mellon University, my hosts mentioned that it is hard to make more friends outside of an initial group or club, with a large school and grading curves creating competition.

what are some things about California Institute of Technology that you love/hate and why?
it's basically impossible to not get research and job opportunities as California Institute of Technology cs. the breadth of courses available is sad though.

how do you feel about the size of California Institute of Technology? i don't really know if i'd enjoy how small it is, since i've never attended.
it's fucking tiny. i like it, some don't.

do you ever get bored in pasadena? is there a lot to do outside of campus?
there's lots to do off campus. most of us are just too lazy to go into la regularly though.

are there strong campus events, clubs, and activities?
mostly just house activities.

how bad/good is core?
core isn't as hardcore as it used to be, but its still a little bit harder than ap x.

is the dismantling of the house system really going to affect the quality of the school?
no, we just like to whine and dramaticize everything.

is it easy to get internships and job opportunities?
yes.

how is stress culture and mental health at California Institute of Technology?
you can get a cs degree averaging like 4-5 courses per term. it's not as bad as people say. assuming you skip lecture like most cs students, expect to put in ~30hrs/wk if you're aiming for a 3.5-3.8.

do you think there's anything unexpected i should consider (i.e. not mentioned in any of these questions) when choosing between these schools?
berkeley girls are cuter.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/88ev8y/tough_decisions_berkeley_or_California Institute of Technology/,"i was accepted to both berkeley and California Institute of Technology but went to California Institute of Technology. 

my parents' friend had a son who went to berkeley. she warned us about getting lost at berkeley because of its size. the story is that her son didn't get much guidance from his advisor and perhaps wasn't very aggressive about taking the right classes, and took a long time to graduate. this caused my mom to panic and change her mind about making me go to berkeley, when before, she was all over berkeley. but at California Institute of Technology i was lost, too, from the difficulty of the classes and not knowing what i wanted to do. the only advice i got from my advisor was that maybe i shouldn't go to college. (this was because i mentioned system administration as a possible career choice. back then i thought it would be cool to hack around on the command line. now i actually am a sysadmin, and it kind of sucks because i'm not good with computers and don't like to maintain systems. most of i do i learned from googling.) 

> do you ever get bored in pasadena? is there a lot to do outside of campus?

pasadena has a couple of museums, the huntington library, and numerous hiking trails in the san gabriel mountains. however, as a student, i didn't go out much.

> are there strong campus events, clubs, and activities?

California Institute of Technology has plenty of clubs, but sometimes they die out because there aren't enough new officers. it's fairly easy to start a club if you get a couple of students together who can serve as officers. it's also easy to get on the sports teams, and i think a fairly large portion of students participate in sports. coaches are aware of the students' workload. in case you're interested, the dance scene at California Institute of Technology is pretty active, and there's an annual dance show.

> how bad/good is core?

when i was a student, core was very rigorous. there was a big gap between ap classes in high school and California Institute of Technology's core. expect heavy proofs and theory. however, core may have become easier recently. 

California Institute of Technology does not give ap credit. berkeley does.

> is the dismantling of the house system really going to affect the quality of the school?

i'm not sure if the quality of the school would be affected. is house culture a factor that draws students to California Institute of Technology? maybe it is for some, but more students are probably drawn by California Institute of Technology's reputation in academics and research. perhaps the loss of house culture would lead to a weaker support system for students, leading to a lower retention rate. but on the other hand, there are students who don't really fit into or like house culture.

> is it easy to get internships and job opportunities?

the top companies recruit from California Institute of Technology, so in general, yes. i never did very well finding jobs or internships, but other people did fine. 

it would probably be as easy, if not easier, to find jobs or internships at berkeley, which has the added benefit of being close to silicon valley.

> how is stress culture and mental health at California Institute of Technology?

i found California Institute of Technology stressful, and so did most of my classmates. i can't say people's mental health was great. i don't know of any suicides at California Institute of Technology while i was a student, but there was a rash of suicides a couple of years ago. (at least four students and a professor all killed themselves in a fairly short span of time, and i know of another suicide a couple of years before that.) California Institute of Technology has a counseling center, and after the suicides, i think they've been trying to be more visible.

i don't know about berkeley, but since it's a huge school not known for being easy, it's probably high stress, too.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/88ev8y/tough_decisions_berkeley_or_California Institute of Technology/,"1) i hate that i m not smart enough for California Institute of Technology. i love that it was a place of learning that was more than i could handle.

2) i liked how the classes later in your college experience were very small and professors were accessible. i disliked how there were so few classmates that you could never escape into anonyMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy. everyone remembers everything about everyone, both good and bad.

3) i never got bored but it was because i was a dancer and hollywood was nearby. you can also plan trips to vegas easily. battlefield vegas to drive a tank, tempest freeruning academy to parkour, dance battles at juice, hollywood show auditions. University of California Los Angeles frat parties.

also blacker house build projects are the best, so was smashing things with sledgehammers, etc.

4) very unique and plentiful campus events that are extremely out of hand and unlike anything else. word of caution; participation in the build and the initial tour are the funnest parts. in the actual parties few people actually dance, lots of people are socially awkward. if you are used to more traditional parties with extroverts, go to University of California Los Angeles parties.

5) last i heard core was getting easier, but while i was there it was rigorous. proof-based mathematics, quantum mechanics, relavity were hard, so was thermo for me. no more quantum requirement, so i ve heard.

6) yes, it will, in many bad ways as well as good ways. the fratty nature of the house system means that when it is good it is very good, but when it is bad is is extremely bad, with hazing, ostracization. peer pressure. personally i am a fan of losing the house system.

7) internships at tech are guaranteed if you apply for surf. people will hire you after college much more readily, but it is not a magic bullet. it took me 6 months to find a perm job after college, but when they finally interviewed me and saw  California Institute of Technology  they let me skip half the interview process and took my 2.7 gpa over 4.0 people from Harvard University.

8) stress is utterly through the roof. mental health help is excellent but it doesn t matter because you still won t be able to handle it. my grades slipped in my senior year because i had to live with a guy with mental health issues who wanted to shoot up the school and we had to have him removed by security and get him treated by a psychiatrist.

9) you will not regret choosing California Institute of Technology.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/mqxz4u/California Institute of Technology_vs_ucsb_grad_decision/,"i can t speak for ucsb all that much, but i can address some of your points here.

- i m not an experimentalist, but my understanding is that joining a brand new lab is actually a really good opportunity. this pi made it to California Institute of Technology, so he s obviously very good at what he s doing (as you have indicated) - so i would say there s really not much risk in joining a new lab here. on the other hand, yes things will be slow at first and you won t be able to pump out results right away, but you re helping build this lab from the ground up - everything is *your* work. that s a pretty nice plus 
- the environment here is pretty intense; most people live and breathe their work, and talk science all the time. that said, there s plenty of well-rounded people with exciting hobbies - i ve been able to make friends here and do plenty of social things. you may have a little trouble coaxing people away from their labs, but it s definitely doable!
- there is an *avid* outdoors community here at California Institute of Technology - from mountain biking to surfing, hiking to rock climbing, skiing to trail running, there are people who do it. not only that, but the people here tend to be social about it - people are always sharing their trips and plans with each other (usually done through the California Institute of Technology alpine club or the California Institute of Technology y). so if that s what you re into, then California Institute of Technology is the right place! (i can t speak for ucsb, but based on its location i think it s be hard pressed to beat what California Institute of Technology has to offer)
- same with sports. i m a basketball player, and i ve actually been able to find a great group of guys to play with (pre-covid, of course)
- yeah, you ll struggle a bit without a car, but it *is* doable - most of the things you need are here in pasadena, and you can access downtown la via the metro (which is... not the best, but it works). there s also enough people here with cars that you can get by for longer/more exciting trips (i for one have a car, and am always down for a good hiking/camping/skiing trip). also, for what it s worth, i feel like goleta is worse than pasadena in this regard - its a small town on the coast, with no major urban centers nearby (santa barbara really isn t that big)
- the mountains do rock!! i personally learned to ski this season at big bear, so i get your excitement there!
- i m not sure what department you d be in, but in physics, there s virtually no barriers to collaboration; most pis actually encourage it (in fact, in condensed matter theory, the postdocs aren t even hired to a specific group - they re floaters). so your department may be more open to it than you realize 
- again, i cant speak for your department, but i ve found a lot of the profs in condensed matter theory to be quite laid-back and low pressure. i do know some of the experimentalists can be more demanding, but the point is that just because they re a prof at California Institute of Technology doesn t mean they re super demanding 


overall, i don t think there s much  risk  in coming to California Institute of Technology, outside of your (valid) worries about work-life balance. i do think you d be fine, since your love of the outdoors fits in well with the community. you also have easy access to one of the largest cities in the world, so you d be able to find whatever else it is you want.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/mqxz4u/California Institute of Technology_vs_ucsb_grad_decision/,"i was at a similarly rigorous school as University of California Berkeley for undergrad, and was also choosing between ucsb and California Institute of Technology for grad school (as was a good friend). are you looking at the materials departments at both? a huge difference is the materials department at California Institute of Technology is really an applied physics department in disguise. take a look at the classes you'll take, and it should give insight on what the department's flavor is like. 

second, i would look at which department has a second or third choice professor for yourself. what would you do if funding for the project you're supposed to be on falls through in your second/third year, if there's a serious personality conflict, or if your advisor gets hit by a bus? this is a much bigger problem with the liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed faculty at California Institute of Technology vs a larger school like ucsb.

by the way, if you want to get to nature, you don't need to drive. there's public transit options that'll take you close to trails in the foothills. you're definitely a bit further from the beach in pasadena (and it's not a really pleasant drive to get to any of them), but i guess it's closer than being in ohio.

in terms of social at California Institute of Technology, i think it's a mixed bag. i had friends that would run marathons whenever there was a big one in town, would go running to santa monica, and took a month off to go backpacking in the mountains of india. a few friends were in a beer brewing club, and i did a beer-league softball team full of international students who had never thrown a baseball before. the California Institute of Technology y has all sorts of outdoor equipment that can be borrowed and organizes group trips to various national parks. that said, there's definitely more focus on your day job than what you do on nights/weekends. work/life balance heavily depends on lab, with the school, in general, not considering it their problem to make sure students don't go crazy. most grad student events are aimed at first/second years and are just free food and lots of booze.

California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/mqxz4u/California Institute of Technology_vs_ucsb_grad_decision/,"i would disagree with your assessment in general - California Institute of Technology is way less risk in this scenario because the brand name means that you could do meh work and still get a nice postdoc position afterwards on the brand-name/connections alone. new-pi is also less risky than an established pi because the biggest real risk in grad school is having a pi that just doesn't care about you or whether your projects succeed. you won't be getting a faculty position in this field straight out of grad school unless you win the lottery with a random discovery or a huge hype-wave in your super-specific research topic just as you are graduating - no point optimizing for this scenario at this point.

in this case, i know what groups you are talking about (used to be at California Institute of Technology materials, now am at ucsb), and the real answer here is to talk to the pis and see who you get along with better. if you want to solely emphasize career success, look at what projects they offer you and do some scouting on which one is the most safe. as an experimentalist working on exotic materials (and everything in the field you described is going to be exotic), 99% of the work is fabricating a high quality experimental system in the first place. this is tedious, non-glorious work that usually takes a phd (or two) to figure out. then a new student comes in on the optimized system and writes all the flashy papers. if you just want to optimize for academic success in this particular field, your choice should be entirely determined by which pi is giving you a prime-time-ready experimental system (or one that is realistically almost there).

regarding work/life balance - this is more of a personal choice between you and your pi. you can burn out or have a very relaxed time at any institution, depending on what kind of pi you get and what personal choices you make. the California Institute of Technology vs ucsb stereotype is a minor blip compared to that.",Comment,Neutral
California Institute of Technology,https://www.reddit.com/r/California Institute of Technology/comments/mqxz4u/California Institute of Technology_vs_ucsb_grad_decision/,"like you, my grad school decision came down to California Institute of Technology vs ucsb as well. i'm not in your field (i'm doing theoretical physics) so i won't comment on your field specific questions, but here's what my pros and cons were, and here's how they played out. 

like you, i really liked the fact that ucsb students seemed more ""well rounded"" and it seemed to me that ucsb students were less tied to their advisor than at California Institute of Technology (an option in theory, but probably not experiment) and there seemed to be a lot more collaboration. on the other hand, California Institute of Technology had a wider range of people doing the research i was interested in and frankly better physicists (at least in the field i was considering)

i spoke to a lot of my undergrad professors about this, and the best peice of advice i got was a one line email ""go to California Institute of Technology, retire to ucsb""

so i did. 

here is how it played out for me. 

on the academic side: i found out that the is a lot of collaboration, even some of my advisors best students were not really his students, they just worked together enough that it seemed like it. there are a lot of postdocs here that are really helpful and accessible. the department is small enough that even with covid happening for the last year and change, i already know more than 80 percent of the theory grad students, across the entire range of theorist physics. 

on the extracurricular side: i have a very healthy work life balance and my advisor is really chill about it. (in part i was able to get such an advisor because called had so many good people that it wasn't hard to find a phenomenal physicist who is also an amazing human being) there are a lot of single minded, work focused people here, and that's them. but there are also a lot of well rounded people here too. until covid happened, i had around 15-20 hiking friends. the California Institute of Technology y has a ton of gear you can borrow for hiking and does multi day hiking trips. there is a large group of skiers/snowboarders that do serious trips out in the mountains. we went into la for museums, restaurants and sightseeing. not everyone here is one dimensional. 

California Institute of Technology is not lost in middle of a city, its a two hour walk (or hour-ish bus ride) to the base of the mountains, i.e. the angeles national forest. i've gone hiking there numerous times.

University of California San Diego,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of California San Diego/comments/8p7tj5/University of California San Diegos_hardship_is_it_real/,"i'm going to be completely candid here, going off my experience with a majority of the University of California San Diego classes, and having a lot of Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Carnegie Mellon University/berkeley friends, and having had tried to do some of their hw's, sit in on their lectures, and just compare course difficulty in general:

University of California San Diego is far easier in terms of course material/depth, but the quarter system makes it so the workload is ""more"" in the sense that you have far less time to do homework (and may be rushed for finals)

classes like 30 (which you might find hard) aren't conceptually hard, they're hard because of the amount of work needed in coding up the pa's, as well as the liMassachusetts Institute of Technologyed amount of time you have to do the pa's (where you really need to manage time well to be able to handle all the bugs and whatnot)

yes many semester schools get a dead week, but that doesn't cover the other 14-15 weeks, and the semester system gives you more time for depth which means harder concepts (it definitely helps for finals unlike our saturday finals)

part of it is yes you may be new to cs and may still be just figuring out things by cse 12/30, but by the upper divs you should be well-versed/familiar with the workload (i'd say 30's workload is more than a majority of upper-div courses), and that is where it's night/day about our courses vs that of the top cs schools

for example:

this is [Massachusetts Institute of Technology's second lecture](https://ocw.Massachusetts Institute of Technology.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/lecture-notes/Massachusetts Institute of Technology6_046js15_lec02.pdf ) of their algo course (101 equivalent) and they're already covering medians of medians



we don't get to quick select/medians of medians until week 7 in algos normally, meaning Massachusetts Institute of Technology literally has 15 weeks of other content whereas we have 3


Stanford University 's cs161 (101 equivalent) seems more comparable, but definitely harder than jone's 101 (maybe not than kane/kahng): http://web.Stanford University .edu/class/archive/cs/cs161/cs161.1176/homeworks/hw2.pdf

however, they still go into more topics than us, with more emphasis on rigorous proofs (which kane's class does a good job at): http://web.Stanford University .edu/class/archive/cs/cs161/cs161.1176/lectures/cs161lecture16.pdf

Carnegie Mellon University jumps straight into complexity, their undergrad course depth is >>> 105 + 200 (grad complexity at University of California San Diego): https://drive.google.com/open?id=10nx0snotyu8a1yo4p_v21q1etaqovnyh

Carnegie Mellon University's bst/splay tree notes (alvarado's 100 lecture covers the bst parts, but she skips the proof but acknowledges its there): http://www.cs.Carnegie Mellon University.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-f17/www/lectures/lec04-splay.pdf

Carnegie Mellon University's segment/fenwick tree notes (which we don't cover in either 100 or 101): http://www.cs.Carnegie Mellon University.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15451-f17/www/lectures/lec05-powerful-arrays.pdf





all in all like yes University of California San Diego isn't easy, but if you think University of California San Diego is harder than most privates (in terms of course difficulty) you have to be absolutely kidding me, it may have a faster pace than semester schools, but there are plenty of quarter privates (Stanford University , California Institute of Technology, uchicago), etc. ivy leagues/Stanford University  do have grade inflation, but there's also plenty of schools which don't and just have bright students (California Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University , etc.). they are higher ranked for a reason, but that doesn't mean we're not bad or anything, just not *as* good as them (i.e. a recruiter would take the average Massachusetts Institute of Technology student over the average University of California San Diego student, but that doesn't mean your job hopes are sunk, it just means you have to put in more work)

also consider just how many of your classes end up being curved - 12, 101, 105, 107, 110, 120, 130, 131, 140l, 141, are all classes that had a curve, and if you check on piazza after a hard midterm/final there are also definitely people that feel entitled to a curve, even begging for it. 

sure you care about your gpa, but there are plenty of schools without curves, just because they're more selective in their students, and thus the students on average may do better -> there's no need for a curve, there's people that struggle, and always some people that will do well regardless of how hard a class is

that said, University of California San Diego does still prep you well for industry, but we definitely don't get the course depth/difficulty in undergraduate (the grad classes really expose the real amount of math that's normally covered in a semester's school undergrad, as they have the time to go into the depth behind such a class), the main difficulty is really the pacing of the quarter system which means you really have to manage your time well to do well

University of California San Diego,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of California San Diego/comments/8p7tj5/University of California San Diegos_hardship_is_it_real/,"it's not easy, but i definitely feel that the overall difficulty of University of California San Diego is tremendously exaggerated online. i can only speak from my perspective in the mathematics and computer science departments. 

all the cs courses i've taken here so far (up to cse 110) have been manageable.

you don't need to a prodigy to get good grades in those cs classes, but you're expected to spend a lot of time working on the assignments and studying the concepts.

that same logic applies in math. the basic math 20 series has a heavy emphasis on only teaching you how to solve problems. doing well in those classes boils down entirely to doing lots of practice problems.

the class where i've noticed most of my classmates struggle is with math 109, as high schools don't really teach discrete mathematics / proofs at all. i can't speak for further upper division math course, as i'm not there yet.

the students who struggle the most in my experience are those who lacked had a solid foundation in their early classes.  i've met students in cse 12 who had no clue how classes worked in java, as well as students who completed math 10a without even a basic understanding what a derivative actually meant. these cracks build up tremendously over time.

bear in mind, i can afford to spread out my courses so that i only take 12-16 units every quarter. those with financial stresses that can't afford to do this will definitely have a different story.

i don't want to discount the stories of students who are actually struggling, their hardships are legitimate. in addition, students who came from under performing high schools can find the transition especially rough.

at the same time, i would definitely not categorize University of California San Diego as being abnormally difficult among other universities. the students who struggle here would definitely also struggle at berkeley, University of California Los Angeles, ucsb, etc.

private universities on the other hand are a different fish. students at those institutions often get semi-regular appointments with a counselor whose job is to catch struggling students. at public schools, you're relatively left on your own.",Comment,Neutral

Massachusetts Institute of Technology is for real hard. no grade inflation there. there's so many stories of suicides of Massachusetts Institute of Technology students from stress alone.

the difference is the quality of instruction. private institutions value the undergraduate learning experience. they will hire instructors well versed and willing to teach. if they didn't then, no one would want to pay so much to go there. University of California San Diego will not do that. i've wasted more time learning things from source material or other universities than learning from lectures. that could be because accent, personality, or the textbook explains it better. and that means we'll end up chewing up more time than other students. other students ""learn the test"", more or less.

when i first came to University of California San Diego as a freshman i was really scared to be on my own and i didn't process it well. what kept me together was the people that i've met over the years, even if i only knew them for a quarter, i was grateful that we got through classes together helping each other. while some of those faces are gone, i'll always be grateful. so i would say that people you'll find in University of California San Diego are some of the nicest.

i also really recommend trying to get to know your professors. it helps you to maintain higher standards for yourself. this is because if the professor knows you, you are less likely to accept the idea of them seeing you fail. also, spending time with them usually means discussing the material further.

i was also a cs major, and recently graduated. if you need help, or just need someone to talk to, please reach out. i'd be happy to discuss how we can make things better, because your experience ***can*** be better. in the meantime, there are a few things you can do to make your cse experience more pleasant. here are a few:

1) ***find your cse support group:*** most ""successful"" cse majors i met while at University of California San Diego had a reliable group of friends with whom they would study and partner up for homework. this is key, because otherwise classes can get really overwhelming. truth is, the quarter system is brutal, and so it's important to have a shoulder you can depend on when things get hard. i have certainly ""carried"", and been ""carried"", in assignments when other classes got rough. i can emphasize enough how important it is for you to create this group.

**2) never skip class, go to every single office hour:** never skipping class should be obvious, catching up from a lecture at 2x speed just isn't the same: things don't stick as well as during lecture. trust me, every time i've skipped lectures i've ended up regretting it. i stopped early sophomore year when i realized i was just shooting myself in the foot; my grades improved dramatically shortly after. also, going to class, is a great way to meet people for your ""cse support group (1) \^"". similarly, go to every single office hour and pretty much do your homework while at it. seriously, just work through problems with tas. even if you don't have questions, just be there and start working and raise your hand when you're stuck. first, it makes homework go much faster. second, a tas perspective on a problem can often help you challenge misconceptions you accidentally picked up in class.

**3) start early, start often:** start your homework and pas as soon as they are released, and work on them a bit every day. this is just good planning, and it helps with (1) and (2).

you may feel like this is a lot of time comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyment, but if you do this you'll actually end up pulling fewer all-nighters and be less stressed, because you'll always be on top of work. also, when you are on top of work, you often find yourself with more free-time :) 

even with all this, the quarter system \*is\* quick, and that can be stressful. however, a change of perspective may help you see the end of the tunnel. yes, midterms start week 3 and then, in some way, they ""never end"" because another class may schedule its exam in week 4, and then you're hitting the second round of midterms week 6, and 7, but then finals are just around the corner.  at the same time though, if you know how to ""play the game"", you'll realize that if you just focus hard for the first 3 weeks, then the first midterm covers so little material that it's totally possible to ace it. by that point, you've build up a gpa cushion in case things get a little out of hand for the second round of midterms, you know?

things can be better bud, i promise. reach out, if you need to.",Comment,Neutral

University of California San Diego,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of California San Diego/comments/ghrxf1/anyone_else_really_hate_college/," i know  real life  is going to be worse  
i wouldn t necessarily agree, at least it wasn t the case for me. i worked part time and was on finaid while i was at University of California San Diego. used to be really spiteful and sad, and also feel disappointed/disheartened with the whole academic dishonesty thing that was common in college. it took me five years, but i finally finished last spring. since then, life has been pretty enjoyable compared to college. one of the biggest improvements is that my schedule is now a lot more predictable and under control. in school, my schedule and availability were dictated by exams, assignments, and ever-changing class schedules; but, now that i m working a more predictable 9-5, i am able to plan my days better. when i was in school, the notion of 9-5 made me feel like i would have less control of my time; on the contrary, i have a better gym schedule, meal times, *sleep schedule*, and time for friends and family. 

maybe i just got lucky and maybe our situations (or majors) are completely different, but i wouldn t dismiss the idea of life improving after college. i found college to be a really stressful and challenging time, but a temporary one nonetheless. i don t really know your full situation, but i m sending you warm wishes.",Comment,Neutral

University of California San Diego,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of California San Diego/comments/ghrxf1/anyone_else_really_hate_college/,"think of it this way: what about college is making it unbearable to you? if it s the stress of the high expectations put upon you, i highly recommend reaching out for the sake of your mental health. therapy would get you through this a lot easier. is it your major? i d recommend visiting departments and speaking to advisors and other students to consider what d be a better fit. is it the idea this will be your life forever? it won t. real life may be tougher but i think it ll be heaps better than college. high expectations from your employers and responsibility will still exist, but you don t have constant deadlines (beyond work projects), exams every week, essays to write, classes to sleep through, and you re gonna be making money. 

i felt the same way you did last year as a freshman but i ve since changed my major and adjusted study habits and a whole other slew of things that ve improved my college experience (but not all at once). it s still not perfect, but making college enjoyable and bearable is the goal, my friend. godspeed.",Comment,Neutral

you may not be the richest, you may even run into hard times. but there's many ways to be successful. my dad, older brother, and brother in law each work in blue collar labor (hvac, electrician, plumber) and they can afford homes in the bay area. yea they work hard, and not many grow up saying ""i want to be a plumber"", but they enjoy solving real physical problems so it fulfills them. find what fulfills you.

first and foremost take a deep breath and know that its okay. you'll make it through school, and thats coming from someone who was disqualified and worked back into this place and graduated with a job offer despite my shit gpa. this school really does prep you for the real world man, and seeing as your cs i'm sure your attitude towards your classes will change once you start working. pick up a copy of cracking the code interview, apply to as many internships as possible and find something else to keep your mind busy.

i say all that to say, you can always finish out this year and then go to community college then transfer back. it won t make you look bad at all, tho it isn t a guarantee you will get back in so i would talk to an advisor if that s what you would like to do and feel is best for you. don t feel any shame about doing it!! mental health comes first. i remember feeling such shame and embarrassment when i dropped out just to go to community college but really, there was no better option. i felt like i was sinking, it was so terrible. but honestly talk w an advisor and like another person said reflect on what u think is best for you. but i do think taking a break to figure out what you want to do is for the best because allowing urself to stay at a school (in general) when u dont know what u want out of it, isn t going to work out. so feel this year out and re-evaluate at the end of it and see where you stand. it could be a temporary feeling or it could be a genuine feeling.",Comment,Neutral

i really love how there s a lot of resources available to me! as someone who came from a very low income family, town, and high school. i m amazed at how much resources and help there is for all aspects of my life. medicine, mental health, shipping, food stamps, lawyer, career, tutoring, space for meetings/lounging, mentors, covid, food banks, sports, activities, art, plays, there is so much more too! every quarter i find something new that s available to me as a student. and at University of California San Diego it s all pretty good quality and either free or low price. 

i also really enjoy the safety ness of campus (more so in previous years, ie before the trolley). most of the individuals on campus are friendly relaxed individuals who are usually willing to help you and don t have some alternate agenda. classrooms, lounges, and public areas are kept clean and imo there aren t that many creeps loitering around campus. 

also there s trails on campus for hiking! which i have utilized alot this year very relaxing and makes you forget you re on a college campus for a bit. 

also the teaching staff here is amazing! i find myself amazed by the talent that most of my professors have and their accomplishments! does anyone else have this same feeling??? i ll be sitting in class like kinda shocked that i m learning from a pioneer in the industry (cogsci mostly since that s my major) 

also just the treatment of students and accessibility to tests, shelter, and policies during covid compared to other schools (cough cough sdsu) says a lot. i was very grateful to be a University of California San Diego student during the darker times of the pandemic.

professors love it when students come to their class just for the love for and the desire to learn. it sets you apart from people who just want to graduate; scoring research with these professors like saul, dasgupta, ochoa, cottrell is 10x more valuable than taking a 10-week course. they can write a recommendation for you

as for cse majors taking up cogs 118/108 classes, that is a fuck up on cogs' end, not cse's . blame your department for their ineptitude in not getting you the classes that you need. cogs should 100% be giving you guys priority enrollment for these courses and should have cse majors/math-cs/ece pre-auth. if seats are left after cogs majors are done, then other majors can enroll on a first come first serve basis.

i wanted to take 150 this quarter, but i got into cse after enrolment ended so couldn t take it. before i got in, i just had one goal: learn probabilistic ai and rl cause robotics genuinely interests me. i didn t care about enrolment or priority or any dumb logistical issues. i knew that i just cared about learning(no pun intended). so, i fervently attended lectures and discussions. did the hw until i got into cse at which point it did not make sense to go to class as i can just take it for credit next time it is offered.

when i was math-cs, i further remember feeling that hey i am a 60% cs 40% math. i want my degree to be mostly cse. but, in truth, once you get in, you look at the same curriculum and you realise - thats a lot more math than cs. i was in truth getting a degree that is more quantitative than computational and the computational side covered programming fundamentals but is taking me more towards theory.

last, it s high time. cogsci should get capped as balls. all cogs majors should sincerely speak to their department about this issue instead of blaming all this on the cse department.

i sincerely honestly feel that math/cs is getting unfairly dicked. their courses can form a strong foundation in ai and the cse department should figure out how they are going to help math-cs take more practical ml classes that can aid them in their career goals.

the big reason i see why cse shouldn t be first come first serve is that it s just too desired in this university. what i mean is that only a few cogs sci students can t take a course because it gets filled up, whereas if they make cse first come first serve literally every other cse student would probably have to delay their graduation date by a year because all 3rd year and 4th year students from other departments would take their spot in every class. i m a sophomore cse student right now and even with priority i couldn t get into cse 101 and 150 this quarter, imagine if i didn t have priority: i would probably not be able to take unitl next year s spring. 
obviously the best solution for this from the cse department is to expand. the cogs department however can also have a good solution without having to restrict courses to only cogs sci: just have priority enrollment in overcrowded course like cse does. would be fair and square.
my biggest point is that cse /ece definitely don t take that many spots in classes that they delay cogs sci and math majors graduation. yes, a second or third year cogs sci might not be able to get into cogs 118a once. but it s an elective and they for sure can do it fourth year. cse on the other end wouldn t even be able to do 100,101, until end of third year/beginning of fourth. which are major core classes that are also prereqs for all other cse classes.",Comment,Neutral

1. most departments want major electives to be almost all upper-level coursework, so that's going to almost always involve prerequisites in the world of math, stats, and eecs.
2. stats 206 doesn't count probably because of #1.
3. stats 306 also doesn't count probably because of #1 (it isn't really an upper-level stats class).
4. eecs 298 also doesn't count probably because of #1 (although i am a little interested in why they wouldn't let you petition for this or 306 to count for a little bit of credit towards the major).
5. si classes are usually less quantitatively and theoretically rigorous than eecs and stats classes, which is probably why those departments have a propensity to not grant major credit for si coursework.  however, it doesn't justify the haphazard/arbitrary choices of what they have picked as counting/not counting, as you describe.

someone else described informatics as a potential choice.  it has more flexibility than data science for elective coursework.  however, since life science informatics is the only available track, you kinda get screwed by the weedout coursework in 3 ways:

i'd say michigan and illinois are both pretty solid choices academically when it comes to cs, business, and anything pre-med or health care -related. though michigan is, sadly, one of the most expensive public universities in the country. however, do keep in mind that you have to complete a separate (and quite competitive) application if you want to do a business double major/minor in the ross school.

still, i believe there are still other things other than academic prestige to keep in mind when choosing a college to ~~waste~~ spend your next four years of your life at. visiting the schools may be out of the window due to the pandemic, but do browse through the schools' subreddits, try to email a few clubs on either side that may interest you, watch our march madness basketball games on tv, and just try imagining yourself as either a wolverine or an illini. choose whichever school that has a more relatable atmosphere, one that you can learn to love as much as you love your family or your best friends, one in which you are less likely to feel left out as if you were an imposter. also keep in mind that ann arbor is physically a lot closer to a large city (detroit) than urbana-champaign, and you just won't find that kind of natural scenery down in illinois. our winters, unfortunately, are equally as crappy.

(though i have to say that illinois basketball fans seem to be a lot less chill than those on our side -- even going as far as claiming the regular season big ten champion title that we won by having the highest winning percentages in the conference. these have been the terms on which even they agreed on merely two weeks ago!)",Comment,Neutral

i obviously can t speak much about other schools, but i do know that double majoring with cs is really tough. i personally am doing a double major with cs and ds and despite the course over lap it s gonna be a marathon just to graduate on time. another friend of mine is double majoring with ioe and cs and he feels the same way. also have another buddy who s (was) the double major with ross and had to knock it down to a cs minor to graduate on time. if money isn t an issue all of that can be fixed with a 5th year, but for some that cost is too much and it s a personal choice. if you re set on doing the double major and willing to put in the work (it s a lot) then michigan can be right for you.

yes, i had to change my study habits. as did everyone else i know.

University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/3xwh35/engineering_difficulty/,"**tl;dr: you're me 20 years ago. you will have to work like you never have before to do well.**

your story now sounds a lot like mine. i coasted through high school with a 3.8 or 3.9 and several aps, including physics c, and i rarely studied. i got a 5 in mechanics and a 2 in emag. (i had mono and didn't know you could reschedule for illness. oh well.) got a perfect score on my sat math. accepted into compe. never really went to any parties in high school. (lots of video games, though.)

i graduated in 5.5 years full-time with a 2.4 gpa, including three academic probations which resulted in a status called enrollment withheld - i had to petition the college to take my last year of classes. i repeated field effect transistors three times and actually never passed it - the coe changed their graduation requirements to remove it from the compe curriculum. i scored in the 30-40% range on exams pretty regularly. i didn't really learn to study, to actually work in anything academic, until my last semester, when i managed a 3.0. ""drastically change study habits"" would be putting it very mildly. i joined a fraternity, but spent more time studying with the other members than partying, so it was actually a benefit academically.

if you're getting c's in high school, you need to take a long look at yourself and decide if a top-tier engineering program (um is #6 nationally in compe according to usnews, above little schools like California Institute of Technology and Princeton University ) is what you want to get yourself into. magna cum laude in high school is middle of the pack at um. the good news is, if your problems are specific to physics, there's not much on the curriculum. the bad news seems to me to be more likely: if it's more a problem with studying things that don't just come naturally, or procrastinating/slacking... listen, i'm not saying you can't. i did. but it was far from easy and if you're less pig-headedly stubborn than i am, you might quit before graduating. that's a lot of money to do your first two years at michigan and finishing up at another school.

the number one thing i learned in school was how to study, how to really work to learn something. compiler construction, algorithms iii, microprocessor architecture, they were all interesting, but i don't use a single one anymore because careers change and being in management doesn't require me to use any of those technical skills. the ability to buckle down, shut out distraction and temptation, and do a difficult thing has been much more useful and is more widely applicable. if you go to michigan, get a bse, and come away learning how to study, it may not be a bad investment. but know going in that you will have to develop a skill you don't currently have and that it won't be a fun process. you'll have fun at school (or you should) but failing classes is a drag.",Comment,Neutral

honestly, the best advice i can give is to go to office hours. the professors can be a great resource. if you dont like a certain professor or ta, you could always just go into the department and ask another professor for help. most of them are more than happy to meet students and help however they can. 

i took a few eecs cources before realizing i thought programming was super boring and switched. you will figure out pretty quick what you like and what you dont. never be afraid to switch to something you are interested in. i found that once i changed to a subject i was legitimately interested in, my grades improved immensely.

there's lots of it and it's reasonably easy to get into. there are programs like urop to make it easier. you can find most subjects that are likely to interest you, and most professors are willing to at least humor you if you volunteer and prove competent.

>do all the big it companies come to campus for career fairs and how much value does the degree hold?

amd, intel, ibm, microsoft, google, bloomberg.... yes. yes they do. the recruiting fairs are *gigantic* events.

michigan coe is one of the best general engineering schools around, and the computer science program is no exception. the degree certainly holds a good deal of value. it's prestigious and widely-known. people recognize and respect the block m.

> also, how difficult are the classes?

they're appropriately difficult for a top-tier school in a top-tier program. which is to say that if you have the knack and apply yourself, you'll be fine. if you try to coast, you're fucked. as it should be.

> will you recommend going to a more hardcore technical school for computer science, like Georgia Institute of Technology?

look. the list of top-tier schools for cs is pretty short. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, berkeley, Stanford University , rh, and some put University of Michigan up there. it's consistently ranked very well in every meaningful way. michigan is not a school one ""settles"" for in engineering in any sense.

beyond that, you'll be exposed to a broad array of other courses. the other engineering departments are equally good and there are plenty of humanities courses for you to slack off in.

also, the alumni association is wonderful for post-school stuff. it's the largest in the world.",Comment,Positive
University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/rwsvm/computer_science_at_University of Michigan/,"kalium summed up most of my thoughts - i also got my degree in cs.

where michigan puts the other schools on the list to shame are in the extracurricular activities.  college is not all about classes (though you will get those ...), it's about the connections you make with other people and the things that you learn to make you a more well-rounded individual.  when you come to michigan, the first thing that you should do is buy season football tickets.  i don't give a shit if you don't like football, this is one of the bonding activities that will solidify friendships that last beyond school.

other activities that will bode well: greek life (contrary to popular belief, there are houses made up of engineers, pre-med students, etc and which focus more on studying), um solar car team (top in the nation and, occasionally, the world), rec leagues for different sports, lots of guest lecturers (i saw john conway [the game of life guy] when i was in school).",Comment,Neutral

sleep comes first, then studying, then fun. sleep being first might sound crazy to some people, but seriously: sleep. sleep makes a miserable college experience into a rewarding one. college is a time to be selfish and to cherish your accomplishments. so sleep so you can enjoy your successes and to have mental fortitude for your failures.

for reference, my story is that i graduated in 2016. i started out mostly as a normal engineering student and was a 3.1-3.3 student for my first two years as i was average in all of the general engineering requirements, and then i did very well in all the upper-level cs courses and ended up just above a 3.5 at graduation. i came in as someone who was a top student at a private high school in the area. but, i also am not the hardest worker in the world. i can grind for hours coding, but am easily distracted while studying.

University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/b9q7kn/how_hard_is_maintaining_35_gpa_in_coe/,"it is very doable. **do not set 3.5 as your goal line.** if you only try to get barely above 3.5, you have a very good chance to get only barely below it and want to hit yourself in the head. aim above it, do as well as you can.

best advice i could offer is pace everything out. you are most likely taking prerequisite courses for the first year. start studying 1.5-2 weeks prior to every exam. this way you can figure out what you do not understand, and start tacking those problems. join study groups.

same thing for the projects. start your projects 2-3 weeks before deadline. if you feel the project is more demanding, start whenever you are taught the material to do the project. i was in biomedical engineering, but i've heard from my friends how tough those cs projects can be. but they are all very doable if you pace everything out and start early. all the people i knew who were struggling did not even start to think about the project 1 week prior to deadline. please join study groups.

find you resources: professors, peers, teaching assistants. ask them about materials you find confusing. talk to your peers about what they think/heard will be on the exams. did i mention joining study groups?

there won't be non-stop grinding. there won't be crying. if you pace everything out, you will have plenty of time to do what you enjoy outside of class.

i don't believe i have mentioned this, but there are plenty of resources for entry-level science classes, especially study groups. go join those.

1. i'm a senior taking a major in the program in biology right now, and there are lots of options for finding research positions! one awesome choice (that i was not part of, but many of my bio friends were) is the undergraduate research opportunity program (urop). you can apply as a freshman or as a sophomore. you take a one-credit, low-effort seminar and they help you match with a professor and project to do independent research that you present at a symposium at the end of the year. there's no guarantee that you find a project, but there's a high chance. this is a great option because finding research as a freshman or sophomore is more difficult on your own. you can also try to find research on your own. cold emailing professors, speaking with your profs about their research. i have found research positions on the student jobs page! there's lots of options and lots of really cool work going on re: conservation bio here at michigan. be forewarned though, that outside of upop, it can be difficult (but not impossible) to find profs who will take on an underclassmen. there's plenty of opportunities for juniors and seniors if you look.
2. to my knowledge, there are no policies of grade deflation in the program in biology. at least, not in any of the classes that i have taken. i have also never encountered any profs who curve down. most intro bio/biochem/chem/etc. classes are graded on a grading scale that's more generous, e.g. a 65-75 is a c instead of 70-75, and so on. stem classes are difficult here, that's no debate, but you are not competing against your classmates. i have never encountered a traditional ""curve"" in any of my pib classes -- others may have different experiences.
3. i am not an oos student, but there's plenty of oos students here. most i've encountered do end up paying full price, as University of Michigan is notoriously stingy with scholarships. if you can get out of University of Michigan with a reasonable and manageable amount of loans, and you are okay with taking them out, i think a degree from michigan is well worth this cost. you, and others, may have different thoughts on that, though.
4. there are asian markets on/near campus! kanbu asian mart is super close to campus, right down one of the main streets into downtown (there's probably others close to campus as well, but this is not my area of expertise). there's definitely plenty of asian markets in driving/bus range off campus as well.

eta: don't underestimate internships! there are plenty of summer programs through University of Michigan in conservation biology and ecology and related fields of study. they can count as credits and are great experiences that will look awesome on a resume! internships through non-University of Michigan companies/organizations/governmental departments can also be an option if you cannot find research for the summertime or if you simply want to do something other than research over the summer. i am biased toward internships because i'm taking my bio degree into industry rather than academia, but it's good to keep an open mind!",Comment,Neutral

i would also think about what type of conversation you are interested in. University of Michigan is very into fishes and freshwater systems. of course there are people doing other things but that's a focus. 

look at the professors and see who you would want to work with on research. contact them and see if they would be willing to take you on or mentor you. i would say having done research in undergrad that it was an important part of my application. def go where you think you'll have a chance to do research. 

on a side note, definitely look into the mcnair scholars program. it's for undergrads who are first gen. guaranteed research which you get a stipend for, training for the gre and focus on grad school application. supppppper helpful and great program imo. 

the seas masters program guarantees research in the form of either a group project or a thesis. if you want to do a thesis you have to find a professor that will take you on.

University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/tfh21l/the_university_of_michigan_is_making_it/,"financial aid wise. personally the university has been very generous for me. im oos. i come from a low-income single parent household and ive been working since junior high. i saw in one of your comments that your circumstances are changing bc one of your parents wants to quit their job and invest in a startup but also save money for the future. they dont have to quit. so many people have gotten laid off during this pandemic including myself twice. and my family doesnt even have a savings. the future is dependent on me getting a good paying job out of college. i understand that everyone has different levels of different struggles and one situation doesnt lessen another but it sounds like the funds are there bro you are not the target of financial aid.

as for the credit transfers. im not saying University of Michigan is better than _every_ other university but our classes are fast paced and cover a lot more material than other universities - and this includes the different campuses (i was taking calc at University of Michigan ann arbor and my bf at the time was taking calc at University of Michigan dearborn and we covered more even than they covered). theres a reason University of Michigan doesnt accept certain credit class substitutes and its bc you are missing info we are learning that will help with the higher level classes where that prior knowledge is expected and going into it without it will only make things more challenging for you - which as far as eecs classes go is already extremely challenging and people do fail, people do drop, people do switch majors bc of the relentlessness.

im not saying any of this to discourage you but your complaints just seem a little entitled and im trying to give you the honest truth of the situations from my perspective at least.

now what you can do is apply for different scholarships. ik lsa has a whole list and they are all for different things (not all need based) so you could definitely get some of those. and if you feel that your classes that you want credit for covered all the material you think we cover here then you can subMassachusetts Institute of Technology documentation of those classes (syllabi, hws, exams, notes, etc.) and get them approved for credit that way.

i do hope that you are not discouraged from coming here and you are able to find a way to manage everything in order to be here. best of luck",Comment,Neutral

University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/tfh21l/the_university_of_michigan_is_making_it/,"i think saying the university of michigan does not care at all about transfer students it s not true. the university of michigan is one of the few prestigious institution that accepts a high volume of transfer students. in fact, the acceptance rate is much higher for transfer students than for freshmen. the financial aid situation has nothing to do with your transfer status. financial aid does not really change whether you are a transfer student or freshman. some scholarships are specific for freshman but that s about it. the issue is that oos students in general (regardless of transfer status) do not receive as much aid, and that s true for almost all state schools. 
having that said, the transfer credit issue is very common, although i came in with over 60+ credits and many of them were given full equivalency.

one alternative is taking classes at a michigan community college for another year that will for sure transfer, and you can save money and transfer another year.",Comment,Neutral

the latest census has america overall at 59.3% non-hispanic white and michigan at 61.6% white. the University of Michigan student body is 51.8% white.

i came from an asian-majority community and went to an asian majority high school. was it a bit weird to come to michigan and see more white faces than any other? sure, it was an adjustment. however, that s just the demographical makeup of this country. i am not sure what the university can do about that. 

the um student body is a bubble in racial terms, not because it s more homogenous as implied but because it s in some sense more diverse than a representative sample. of course, that s not true if we only look at urm and there s much work to be done there. but saying um has too many white people is just unrealistic expectation",Comment,Neutral

University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/x3hd13/i_dont_like_it_here/,"i know what you mean. i transferred here last year and it s been the bane of my existence, outside of the education/prestige of the university and degree.

i grew up extremely poor, my mom had to raise four of us growing up and we were evicted more than once which resulted in us losing most of our things growing up. if it weren t for relatives allowing us to crash at their place in between those times, we would ve been homeless multiple times, so i m extremely grateful for that. we used to have weeks where our mom couldn t afford gas money to take us to school or to have hot water/heat at home. i don t know if you ve ever had your hot water turned off, but we did for an entire winter once and it sounds dumb, but that was one of the most miserable experiences i ve had. the temperature difference between turning your shower as cold as it can go vs. having absolutely no heated water because it got shut off is incredible. i remember coming inside from freezing winter days and having to take literally ice cold showers. i mean so cold that i would have to stand in the back of the shower and step in an out when i couldn t handle it anymore. to the point where i was so cold i felt actual, sharp pains run down my spine and would be shivering throughout. again, it seems like a dumb thing to mention, but i doubt a lot of people here have ever had to experience something like that, or having to hoard any blanket/sheets/clothes you had to sleep through a winter night in a house with no heat. since i transferred here last year, my total family income for each year was $0 and $17,000 for a household of six. because of that, the university pays for all of my tuition + gives me some extra and sometimes i feel kind of guilty for it, but who am i to deny free money and an amazing education.

i grew up in a school that was 98% white, statistically (school of 400) in the midwest. for the most part, people there were low income as well, so i never really realized a difference until i came here. i got put in the csp program and i remember during a 1 credit csp required class one day they were talking about how csp is a community and how we re all similar here. they said of everyone in csp, something like 50% had a family income of less than ~$80,000 and somewhere around 10% had a family income of under $50,000. $50,000 was still triple my families income on a good year. that s when i realized how poor my family really was growing up. another thing that made me realize was hearing other students talk about how expensive rent was/how poor they were. at first, i thought i kind of related to them, but then i realized that mine and their definitions of poor were vastly different.

i think a lot of students don t really realize it, but many of them who aren t intentionally cliche rich kids still act that way without knowing it. i ve had people say straight up say things like,  oh, i didn t realize that was a lot of money for you  when talking about prices of things without even realizing it. i don t mean to offend anyone, but i ve yet to talk to someone here, except maybe one or two, that seem  down to earth . it s not anyones fault, it s just the way people were brought about and that s how it is. i ve never really been on vacation, never gone to another country, never seen the ocean or anything like that and to get thrown into a place where it seems like almost everyone vacations to multiple countries every summer is pretty jarring.

with that being said, and growing up the way i did, i d say my first year here (last year) was the worst year of my life. to be somewhere completely new and not make friends with anyone is rough and something i d never experienced before. i m pretty shy, but i ve gotten along with everyone i ve ever met in my life, and i really mean that. i do everything i can to be nice to anyone i meet, but there just seems to be a disconnect here. when i say i ve made zero new friends here in the last year and last few days, i mean that. i come in every new semester/class hoping that that ll change and forcing myself to talk to other people, but after the standard  what s your name/major/year/where are you from? , that s pretty much it and you never see/talk to them again. at this point, i just do my work and try to stay out of peoples way and not talk to/bother anyone. if someone wants to talk to me, i d gladly hold a conversation with them, but no one does. i m just trying to get my degree and get out at this point. i wouldn t wish the way i ve felt the last year or any of the thoughts i ve had on absolutely anyone. and again, this isn t anyones fault, that s just how it is sometimes.",Comment,Neutral
University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/x3hd13/i_dont_like_it_here/,"i'm white, so i can't speak to the racial aspect here, but being low-income, absolutely. i come from a family of 5 living off 30k a year in wayne county.

the amount of people here that i consider rich, that don't think they're rich, is just bonkers to me.

i've never been able to afford to eat the recommended amount of protein daily as a meat-eater, let alone as a vegan. and fresh produce? forget it! 

the privilege as this school has made me feel so bad about myself. i'm finishing up an incomplete right now to graduate for spring/summer, and after being back in my hometown for almost two months, i realized i spent my entire 4 years trying to be good enough and popular enough and liked enough and to present as classy or stylish enough.

the effort that i put into my appearance, even as a nonbinary woman, absolutely drained me. my mental health got so bad and my physical health even worse.

i ended up taking out a private loan this year to afford to have a little bit of fun, to feel like i was as good as everyone else.

i ended up taking out a personal loan for 8k after almost getting evicted trying to keep up here. i still didn't have enough to compete with the people here, or to do half as much as them.

yes, i do realize that that is my fault and i take responsibility for it, but i'm also adhd, autistic, borderline, with ptsd, chronic depression and anxiety / panic disorder, and a history of being bullied and excluded. i also ended up with two separate addictions here, just trying to be enough socially. so uh. left untreated as they were and still are to some extent, absolutely made me more vulnerable to all of that. 

the privilege at this university, and the classism i ended up internalizing because of it... as much as my life changed for the better at University of Michigan (mostly by being away from my abusive family) , it also changed for the worse with my health. 

the first three years, i was sick for about a week out of every month. this last year? my body absolutely broke down. i couldn't do anything. i lost over 30lbs and am still underweight now. i've been chronically voMassachusetts Institute of Technologying since i came back from spring break this year, it went from every day at first to now just 3ish times a week. and because of insurance and shit being backed up because i'm,,,, poor,,, i couldn't get in to see a gastro until july. and my tests are scheduled for next week still. and then i have to wait until november to see the gastro again to have all of it deciphered. 

uhs is absolute shit when it comes to serious shit like this, too. the psychiatrist i saw was belittling and ignorant to everything i had to say and refused to refer me for psych testing. i had to fight with insurance and play phone tag with all of the surrounding offices for months just to do that. and caps? you go in there and tell them everything you're dealing with and they're like,, ""uhhh you need professional help let me refer you to someone"" and bc i have insurance, albeit a shit one, they refused to even consider me for long-term care. 

like. i'm sorry my parents are on their second bankruptcy because they're irresponsible drug dealing addict fuckfaces with no sense of anything adult, i can't relate to any of you. where i come from i had two classmates kill themselves in high-school and half my friends were comMassachusetts Institute of Technologyted for trying. 

there were two sorority girls walking in front of me on my way to work one time (ray's red hots) , and they both started snickering about how if they ever ate there they would just die, what kind of person eats that shit, etc. i still think about it. it still hurts. i quit working there not long after that to take care of my health and my family's, but also because i was embarrassed--though i didn't accept that until recently. 

i also had a friend once say something about the privilege here in that ""yeah my dad didn't go to Harvard University or whatever but he still went to a good university and makes over a 100k"". i didn't say anything, i just let it sting. 

over and over again. and yet i still tried to be good enough for those people. i fell for the oldest trope in the book and i'm so upset with myself for it too. i knew better.

edit to add: i also got caught up in an abusive relationship, and no one here, even my closer and more understanding friends, really got it. when you grow up thinking abuse is love, it takes a while to figure out it's not. and it's exacerbated by finances, because i wouldn't have stayed with him as long as i did if i could've afforded leaving. that's also part of why i took out an extra 8k.",Comment,Neutral

it's echelons of privileged kids who think they're not privileged: the ones whose parents both have degrees, who have houses they own outright and whose parents are helping pay for their college... for instance, community high school/the co-op mentality? these are kids wearing north face and going on vacation twice a year who reckon they're marginalized/being taken advantage of by ""the rich"" solely because it would be possible to have more than they have. 


""the rich"" is a bogeyman every socioeconomic class uses to point to the people above them and blame for everything wrong in their life and the world. if your parents make 100k, those making 250k are ""the rich""; if your parents make 250k, those making 500k are ""the rich""; if your parents make 500k those making millions are ""the rich""; if your parents make millions it's the billionaires and the generational wealth... it never ceases. 


95-99% of people in america are ""the rich"" on a global scale, and if we're redistributing we need to redistribute to africa and asia and south america rather than other americans who are *somewhat* less privileged. if you buy your coffee at a cafe every morning or go to see a movie every month, or your wrap your christmas presents in nonrecyclable paper you promptly throw out, you're doing the same thing that private jet billionaires are doing: just to a different group of less-visible people. every single one of these people is just as hypocritical as the oligarchs and billionaires they condemn.

i also lived in on campus dorms for a while. i have always noticed that at first the dorm events are pretty diverse. but after a while, the group you talk about just retreat into their own clique and never show up again.

the white, upper-class society is one that is very hard to penetrate into. i have definitely gotten ""don't approach me, lower being"" vibes from them. there are also places they go to hang out that you will almost never know about. and once you do and the people not from their group frequents the place, they will start going somewhere else. you don't have to be a minority to have noticed this too, as it is an economic segregation as it is a racial one. 

there is also nothing the administration can do. they can't force them to be your friend.

University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/x3hd13/i_dont_like_it_here/,"there's not an easy fix to this situation. you can't blame the lack of affirmative action, because affirmative action is in itself racist. it essentially says that minorities are not smart enough to compete with white people so we have to dumb things down for them. that's not productive for anybody, and puts under qualified, pseudo-educated minorities into the workforce, unable to perform because they have not had to perform at the same level as they're non-minority peers. so of course they do poorly in the work environment which leads to emphasizing that you should hire such minorities because they are not good employees.

the real challenge lies in reaching poor urban neighborhoods where far too many people are raised to think engaging in illegal behavior is legitimate while holding down a real job is illegitimate. that they will never get ahead because of the color of their skin.

unfortunately to many folks in such communities support this negative mindset, taking pride in living down to negative stereotypes. if you're somebody that acts like a normal, responsible person then you're chastised for not really being a member of that ethnic/cultural group. for example look at how oprah winfrey was criticized for not being black enough because she's intelligent, smart, and successful because she is driven. total horseshit.

the real crime is that in michigan we spend $2 billion dollars a year on our prison system. if we were able to take half that and spend it on programs that are designed to work, not just to become another bloated bureaucracy, in affecting paradigm change in the mindset of people in poor minority cultures. we then may then see more minorities who value education and hard work, and are better able to compete with people who are raised in wealthier communities which value their education.

will this happen anytime soon? no. that's because talking about the real problems that plague minorities will get you labeled as a racist and a bigot. this saddens me because there are so many people, minority or not, who at their core are good people, and just want a shot to achieve their maximum potential.

i should add that getting a good education is difficult for white kids that are raised in communities that don't value education. i was just talking to a lady earlier today who was lamenting the poor education system in the city(<10,000 population) that she moved to. this is a difficult situation to rectify as the community is electing the school board who then hires the school superintendent. if the community is happy with the status quo then what can you do?

we can see this reflected in the ann arbor public schools. they are lauded as being a great school system, but in reality they are a reflection of a student body whose parents are well educated, who value education, and are actively involved in their children's education.

if you're a poor black kid attending ann arbor schools, then you really don't have much coming to you. you get lost in the shuffle as the teacher's focus on the successful kids. i take this opinion from having known several black kids from low income backgrounds who attended ann arbor schools. are there exceptions to this experience?of course there are, but that's not the norm.

in the meantime, we have to deal with enclaves of plastic people such as ann arbor. where folks feign moral indignation while at the same time turning their internal eyes away from the problems which require the greatest effort to resolve. but to your face they will still be morally outraged.",Comment,Neutral

University of Michigan,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/zuj82n/how_is_University of Michigan_for_transferring/,"i transferred into um after my freshman year. the transition was really easy and i made strong friendships in stockwell (a sophomore dorm). i almost got put in the northwoods apartments, but i got a contract reassignment for stockwell - i would recommend trying to get a dorm on central if you can. you could also look for off-campus housing, although like i said, friendships come pretty easily in the dorms, which is huge. 

the actual transfer process was great too. i met with my would-be program advisor before i transferred and made sure all my credits were good, and i could take the classes i wanted. um hosted a really nice transfer student orientation that felt really genuine. i actually loved with two other transfer students in my dorm, and we all had great transfer experiences.

after the first few weeks i felt right at home, more so than my previous university. um is awesome and they do a great job in my opinion of making transfer students feel at home.

one warning i would give you though is that if you re going into a field where you might want to do research under a professor, transferring in as a rising junior (around 60 credits or anything above that) might possibly pretty much bar you from being able to do a senior thesis or even any kind of basic research.

not a single transfer in my department (earth) has been able to do research because all the professors want sophomores or younger. they all basically say it isn t worth the time to train you because you have less than 2 years. it s possible other departments are different, but that has been my experience and it hasn t been for a lack of trying.",Comment,Neutral

the fact that your parents are willing to pay for college at all is a major win in my book. if you really believe that University of Southern California is the right place for you, you could consider paying for a portion of University of Southern California's additional tuition cost yourself, either through loans or scholarships. you might also consider transferring after a year or two and enjoy the best of both worlds. lower tuition and still networking potential+nice weather+rocket lab. 

i don't really think rankings matter all that much. they all rank different things in different ways and are subject to certain biases (i mean, Harvard University, Princeton University , or Yale University are always #1 no matter what in us news). the real selling point of University of Southern California is the connections and the opportunities they afford. nasa has a research center in pasadena, which isn't very far out. viterbi has a great recruiting network including several astronauts. space x and all the defense contractors recruit heavily as well. 

try to make a deal with your parents. you might have to accept some of the additional expense yourself, so tread carefully. look into scholarships; if the price differential is lower, i don't think it'll matter quite as much. it's entirely possible that they just want to keep you closer to home as well.

lastly i would be sure to look into University of Southern California's rocket lab (www.University of Southern Californiarpl.com). in my opinion it's the best undergrad college rocketry program in the world right now (for solids at least). so to me that makes it worth it because even if you could get comparable academics and connections elsewhere, rpl is unique. if being a part of rocket lab and going to work at a company like spacex afterwards (just the general trend lately) doesn't seem like your thing...then maybe you can find what you're looking for somewhere else that's a bit cheaper. still wouldn't make University of Southern California a bad choice though.",Comment,Neutral

as someone who was accepted at both University of California Los Angeles and University of Southern California and who came from a modest background, my decision was simple (to go to the school who gave me more money). people have this misconception about University of Southern California and most private schools for that matter that they are super unaffordable which is absolutely 100% true if you don t apply for financial aid. private schools (especially University of Southern California) have a lot of money, and i m talking a ridiculous amount. consequently, this means they have more room to give more scholarships and money towards new prospective students. i applied for financial aid for both universities and while at University of California Los Angeles they gave me a lot. University of Southern California gave me way more support plus additional finances to ensure i d be able to support myself through my education. of course everyone s circumstance is very different and unique, as a californian resident that is eligible for fafsa/css profile i can guarantee you that University of Southern California will give a lot of university grants to cover your expenses. i received a full ride (about 75k total per year) of scholarships. i even lost my cal grant (about 10k usd) one year due to my family s income being a couple hundred dollars over qualification; while i had been freaking out about how to come up with the money, University of Southern California gave me an extra 10k of university grants to make up for the money lost. not only did it take care of my tuition but i also received an extra 600 dollars leftover. my point is, to the students from low income families, i highly recommend you either find someone to walk you through the financial aid process and/or do some individual research. it can be tedious process; however, think of the end goal of graduating from a top university in california with little to no student debt.

while i m sure the original question was looking for an answer about why the community or area is better, to some, affordability may be the biggest weighing factor, and it is just a fact that private institutions give you more money if they decide that you are worth an investment.",Comment,Neutral

1. sign up for zipcar and use zipcar to get around when you want to go somewhere fun occasionally. it is very easy to use.
2. University of Southern California has hundreds and hundreds of student orgs. there is something for everyone. definitely pick a couple to try relating to your major to help befriend other people going through the same recruiting you are. then pick some fun ones that will get you outdoors and exploring la like sc outfitters(hiking/camping related). clubs are a great way to meet people and make friends. 
3. i wasn't big into american football until coming to sc but i ended up enjoying it mostly for the social aspect. the more you are open-minded about it and embrace the school spirit, the more addicting it becomes.
4. can you request to live in a different dorm at this point?
5. i lived in dtla my last year of school and commuted to campus by expo line and loved it. downtown have a bit of a nyc vibe to it and i loved not having to drive a car. tons of new restaurants and retail are opening or will be opening soon down there. i still work downtown so can give you some restaurant suggestions to try out if you want.

try going to some parties or random school events like the visions and voices shows, join a random club (fencing, perhaps?), and just try to put yourself out there when the opportunity arises. it's surprisingly easy to make friends; just strike up a conversation with people. it may be awkward at first and may not go anywhere, but you'll improve as time goes on and you never know what might happen. 

get out and explore la. buy a tap card and take metrorail somewhere. it doesn't go everywhere, but you can go plenty of interesting places, especially if you don't mind taking metrolink or amtrak. between that and zipcar, you'll be in good shape. if you don't drive, that's what friends are for. see paragraph #2.

eventually, you'll start to fit your new identity and it's pretty hard to be depressed when things are going good. sc has a lot to offer if you're willing to take advantage of it. my advice: jump in with both feet.

University of Southern California,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Southern California/comments/1bkbif/University of Southern California_or_brown_please_help/,"as other people have noted, the cinema school is the top in the nation. with being so integrated in the film industry here, it is a huge advantage that i cannot even describe, especially with the alumni. there are tons of opportunities, so i would not worry about the fact that there are 50+ kids going through it. actually, i see this as a huge benefit. there are tons of stories of people meeting other students in cinema classes and going to work together later. the networking effects and the impact of the alumni totally outweigh the issue of graduating with other students looking for similar jobs.

the question about frats is very dependent on whether or not you want to go to those frat parties. it is completely possible to be really socially active without ever stepping foot in a frat house. most groups, (clubs, social groups, or just groups of friends) just throw parties in someone's apartment. the biggest difference is the perception. it only seems like fraternities control the social scene is because they are constantly advertising their parties and showing their greek letters off. other groups rarely ever do this, so it seems like greek life dominates way more than it really does. even just having groups of friends, there will be plenty of parties and ways to stay socially active. 

also, just as a note, being a freshman makes this seem worse. it is way harder to throw parties in dorm rooms, and everyone who is rushing will talk about it constantly. plus, without knowing that many upperclassmen, it seems like the only way to be socially active is to go greek. i promise that isn't true at all.

i'm a business major, but i'm minoring in cinematic arts, so if i can answer any other questions, let me know.

if you want to work in entertainment, go to University of Southern California.  best school in the nation and you'll be connected.  and hollywood is nothing but connections.  University of Southern California is the place to make them.  

greek life is not necessary.  i was in a fraternity and i liked it.  but 75% of my social life came from belonging to the trojan marching band.  if you don't play an instrument, consider joining the prop crew.  you'll be flown (free) around the country for football games and other events.  it was amazingly fun.

even if you don't join either, i *strongly* recommend getting involved in a campus group or two.  you'll be sure to find one you like.  one of my friends in grad school also went to University of Southern California and he was a campus tour guide.  he had the best time doing that, was friends with all the other guides, they had great parties, and all that.  so you don't have to go greek, but you do have to join some group or other.

also, i think you'd enjoy getting to know la.  it is very different from the east coast.  the city is a patchwork of 80+ communities and it takes a couple of years to get your head around how vast and deep la is.  what looks like a bunch of ordinary strip malls on the surface becomes a lot more interesting as you get to know it better.  when you do, you'll start finding all the hidden gems scattered around the communities and start to love the city.  it's not anything like the touristy stuff suggests.  

when you come to University of Southern California (ok, i'm assuming here) make friends with an la native or two to show you the city.  i'm a third generation native and spent four years there taking people from all over the world to the good stuff.  the city will grow on you and i hope you'll end up calling it home.",Comment,Positive

University of Southern California,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Southern California/comments/1bkbif/University of Southern California_or_brown_please_help/,"hey there, recent graduate of the undergrad production program with a minor in screenwriting here. congrats on getting into the film school! that's an awesome achievement!

my advice/answer in two sections below. and this is assuming that you intend to go into the film industry after you graduate.

**the film school**

pros:

University of Southern California's film school is the best in the nation, as others have pointed out, for a number of reasons: the professionalism and the extremely industry-specific protocols that are taught here correspond to the level of equipment and facilities we have. it's all very state-of-the-art and being updated constantly. we are taught the exact method and manner of film production as it's done professionally. it's very easy to transition from an upper level University of Southern California project to paing on a set and knowing most of what's going on already.

University of Southern California's connections to vendors and businesses in the industry also gives us something of an unseen advantage: we get discounts and student rates on all kinds of gear, locations, and production resources. we even get to work with sag actors for free, provided we feed them on set, credit them in the film, and give them a copy of the finished film.

i think University of Southern California sca's biggest advantage is starting you up with a network in the entertainment capital of the world. proxiMassachusetts Institute of Technologyy and who you know are key; cronyism is the way it works, so getting an education at brown and moving out to la with a few contacts if any is going to be a slower start than getting those connections.

for example, i've already worked with enough people to have a shortlist of producers, directors, cinematographers, editors, sound, etc. to call on for help. similarly, i know several people working at agencies and production companies that, should they enjoy something i've written, will hopefully help me pass it on to more important people.

University of Southern California not only helps you establish a network of friends among your peers and previous collaborators, but also among professors that you connect with and can form relationships with beyond the classroom, working on other projects. for example, i am currently doing motion graphics and trailer cutting for a documentary that a previous professor of mine is making, and i'm editing a documentary of another professor at the school.

coming to la cold turkey will not get you those kinds of connections without having lived and worked here for a few years.

cons:

having said that, it's a competitive environment within the school and it is a microcosm of the industry itself -- not everyone has access to the fullest resources at all times, especially in undergrad. the grad program allows upper level students more freedoms and better access to direct or produce sponsored projects that the school hosts, including the subway webseries, among others.

though i feel fine about having gone to University of Southern California as an undergrad, it really means that i don't have many good options for a film grad program apart from afi.

**frats/social life**

social activity is possible with or without joining a frat. last i checked, only 30% of the school are part of a greek house. you think the other 70% don't party? frat parties are frat parties, and if you're into that sort of thing then it's probably important for you to join a frat to be in on those parties.

as you can tell, that wasn't really for me. but i went to enough parties that weren't hosted by frats, and i didn't go to a lot more that were going on. i never went to a single frat party (the cinema frat doesn't count, because their house isn't on the row).

so it depends on what kind of social life you need to feel socially active.

i hope this was a little helpful.

i'm actually good friends with someone that works in admissions who can help you out and answer any further questions you have in detail. pm me and i can get you the contact info.",Comment,Neutral
University of Southern California,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Southern California/comments/1bkbif/University of Southern California_or_brown_please_help/,"10 production grad here and have been working in 'hollywood' ever since. besides what has already been said...

1. i can't stress enough how powerful the University of Southern California mafia is. every single potential employer that has interviewed me has been an sc grad (film and non film). i myself have definitely screened resumes of possible interns or new hires and prioritized trojans. it's just a sick sick awesome cycle.

2. all these pros and cons being said... if you do end up going into sc production, please please please do other projects on the side that aren't just for class. start your own youtube or vimeo channel and make shit with your friends. all the time. University of Southern California owns the rights to the films you make in class (at least they did when i was there), so its super important to have your own portfolio of things you can put on the internet. plus, you will come out of school with way more experience, knowledge, and fond memories of making these with your homies. the University of Southern California film curriculum was sometimes a little restricting for me, so it was really liberating, fun, and beneficial to do cool experimental stuff on the side. a project i did on the side with some chapman film students got me my first job.

3. also, if you do decide to go to sc, take art classes on the side. sca doesn't have you shoot on real film any more. knowing the basics of photography will give you an edge in the long run, even if you don't plan on becoming a dp.

frats arent that important. that's not to ignore the fact that it seems like everybody is a part of one here, but they're still not that important. it's all about what you want to get out of your time here. there's a cinema frat, dka that could potentially bridge the gap for you in that regard.

University of Southern California,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Southern California/comments/1bkbif/University of Southern California_or_brown_please_help/,"my answer would differ depending on what it is exactly, you want to do. do you have any ideas on particular careers within the business? 

(and it's ok if you don't know yet - many students go in wanting to be directors or producers or writers and discover a different aspect of the business that calls to them the most.)

i'm currently a grad student in one of the mfa programs and can't really provide a perspective on greek life but can offer this take. the business is entirely about networking - it truly is a 'who you know' business no matter what career path you choose. showbiz is an apprenticeship-based meritocracy, so it's very much about earning your stripes and you can't do that without getting your foot in the door. that's where your network comes in. 

are you good at socializing by yourself? then you don't need greek for your network though it probably wouldn't help. if you need a little help developing your social skills, maybe consider the greek option (the film one seems like a good idea).

huge. 50 kids a year is not flooding the industry at all - film is a big business and i know students outside of sca who also work in film. but being at University of Southern California, in la, is going to make it a million times easier to get into the industry. being an alumni is that helpful because University of Southern California has a great alumni network and the University of Southern California film school name is very well recognized. i never realized until i got to college how much of a boost it is just to go to college in the same town you want to work in the future.

i can understand this is incredibly frustrating and often times a lonely experience. while i can t relate to the cs program specifically, i can definitely say i experience some of the same in my graduate program.

try to be cognizant of the fact that many of these individuals have done nothing but code and play video games for year and years and years. what happens when you do that? well you get pretty damn good at coding (and video games) and probably pretty poor at dealing with people in an empathetic and compassionate manner.

i d stay stick it out and try to find something outside the cs program to meet people if you don t fit in for sure. eventually when you get to the work force, your desire to be friendly and helpful will be far more important than marginally better coding skills from being a herMassachusetts Institute of Technology. just my two cents.",Comment,Neutral

University of Southern California,https://www.reddit.com/r/University of Southern California/comments/r61pu3/dream_grad_schoolnot_so_much_anymore/,"lots of good discussion here but for op i'll add that University of Southern California is a really big university with something around 1,000+ student organizations on just about every topic you can think of. though a few orgs are focused on undergrad, or on grad students, many are accepting of students regardless of their major.

yes it might be good to pick one that focuses on cs to help you with career/recruiting though you shouldn't feel forced to befriend everyone in it. i'd check out some non-cs clubs that might help you connect with students across the school with a more diverse set of interests and hobbies.",Comment,Positive
